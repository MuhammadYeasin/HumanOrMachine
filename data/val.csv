"There was a groundbreaking surgery performed here in Houston, TX.

A baby was born recently that had a congenital condition that caused problems with the development of the delicate tissues on his face. The poor child was born without eyelids. Resourceful doctors and surgeons came up with a plan to circumcise the baby boy and use his foreskin to construct new eyelids, which a talented local plastic surgeon then attached to the existing tissue around his eyes. They can't say for sure how functional the new eyelids will be later in life, but for now the surgery appears to be a huge success, and constant lubrication of his eyes is no longer necessary.

Bob Hill and his new wife, Betty, are vacationing in Europe, near Transylvania. They re driving in a rental car along a rather deserted highway. It is late, raining very hard and Bob can barely see the road in front of the car. Suddenly, the car skids out of control. Bob attempts to control it, but to no avail. The car swerves and smashes into a ditch.. Moments later, Bob shakes his head to clear the fog. Dazed, he looks over at the passenger seat and sees Betty unconscious, with her head bleeding. Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to get her medical assistance. He carefully picks her up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light and heads towards it, which is coming from a large, old house. He approaches the door and knocks. A small, hunched man opens the door. Bob blurts, “Hello, my name is Bob Hill and this is my wife Betty. We’ve been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been Seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone?” “I’m sorry,” replies the hunchback, “but we don’t have a phone. My master is a doctor. Come in, and I will get him.” Bob brings his wife in. An older man comes down the stairs. “I’m afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor; I am a scientist. However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had some basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory.” With that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab. Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table. After a brief examination, Igor’s master looks worried. “Things are serious, Igor. Prepare a transfusion.” Igor and his master work feverishly, but to no avail. Bob and Betty Hill are no more. The Hills’ deaths upsets Igor’s master greatly. Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. It is here that he has always found solace and he begins to play. A stirring, almost haunting melody fills the house. Meanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up. His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty’s hand twitch, keeping time to the haunting piano music. Stunned, he watches as Bob’s arm begins to rise, marking the beat. He is further amazed as Betty and Bob both sit up straight! Unable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory. He bursts in and shouts to his master: “Master, Master! The Hills are alive with the sound of music!”",human,5otqdt,18,1484790415,0

"A guy with a bad stutter goes to see the doctor. [nsfw]

He tells the doctor the stutter is ruining his life by making it very hard to get a date. The doctor recommends a thorough examination to which the guy agrees.\n\nWhen the guy drops his pants, the doctor sees an enormous penis and determines that is the cause of the stutter. \n\n“What can be done?” the guy asks. \n\n“The only way to correct the problem is to reduce the size of your penis,” days the doctor. \n\nIt’s a very difficult decision for obvious reasons, but the guy figures it’s better to be able to go on dates so decides to go through with the procedure.\n\nThe operation is a complete success and the guy’s stutter is completely gone. He’s so excited and immediately strikes up conversations with women and sets up dates.\n\nMany of the dates go well and he takes the women back to his place. But every time, when they get into bed, the women laugh at his now very small penis and leave.\n\nThe guy goes back to the doctor knowing that he made a mistake and needs to reverse the operation.\n\nHe sits down in the doctor’s office and explains the situation. “Doctor, I need to reverse the operation as soon as possible!”\n\nBut the doctor replies, “su-su-su-su-sorry.”",ai,ai_5009,0,0,1

"Three Sinful Men

It just so happened one particular day that three particular men died particularly sinful deaths. The first was a cattle rancher from Montana who was shot in the back by a jealous husband as he tried to jump out a second story window. The second was a college student from California who overdosed on heroin. The third was a musician from Michigan who had killed himself after murdering his ex-wife. As the final breaths left their lungs and the final spasms wracked their failing bodies the souls of these men were magically whisked away to the infernal plane to await their final judgment. Naked and chained the terrified sinners gazed about the hellish environs in abject confusion. Without warning a towering pillar of flame erupted before them, and as a blinding shower of sparks dissipated the quivering men could make out a demonic silhouette. ""Kneel before me cretins, for I am your new god!"" screamed a voice equal parts unfathomable evil and undeniable seduction. The command was accompanied by the crackle of a vicious whip and the pungent scent of brimstone. The three men immediately prostrated themselves before the succubus and began to plead pitifully for leniency. "" Silence you wretches!"" was the heartless reply to their mewling. Amid the choked sobs and sniffles of the bewildered sinners a pointy toothed grin was taking shape on the mouth of the demonesse. As her wicked expression grew more intense the succubus began to laugh a shrill, haughty laugh which chilled her audience to the bone despite the oppressive heat of the fiery realm. "" Very well, if it is reprieve you seek from your just punishments then I suggest a wager."" the succubus chided. The men lifted their heads and began exchanging wary yet hopeful glances. ""I strike this pact with you three, if I can grasp your manhoods for a count of three times three without thee screaming, falling or fleeing then may you enter the accursed realm of heaven!"" The rancher was the first to respond, gathering what tattered shreds of his dignity remained he stood tall and said, "" well, I reckon it's worth a shot lady."" The fires of eternal damnation gleamed behind the succubus's eyes as she sauntered towards the condemned man. As her clawed hand closed around his member, the ranchers eyes grew wide with pain. Smoke escaped from the demons grip as the man cried out in ultimate suffering. His Johnson having been reduced to cinders, he was cast down to hell in a stinking plume of fire and brimstone. The college student was visibly shaken by this turn of events but steeled himself nonetheless. ""I guess I don't have anything to lose..."" he muttered as the succubus gleefully encircled his penis with her smoldering talons. His screams began immediately as his family jewels became a puddle on the ground. He too was cast screaming into the darkness. The third man was strangely calm, the beginnings of a wry smile dancing about the edges of his mouth. ""A'ight girl, let's see what you got."" he bravely challenged. Incensed by the man's temerity, the succubus seized upon his trouser snake with such force it seemed she might tear it off. Expecting to hear immediate howls of anguish the succubus became increasingly perplexed as her awkward tug of war dragged on without a sound. The seconds ticked by without incident until eventually the demon was forced to relent. She stared in awe as radiant white pinions began to sprout from the man's back. The faint sound of an angelic choir could be heard as a thunderous white light broke through the perpetual gloom of hell. The man's face pointed upwards as he began to ascend to heaven. Frustrated and confused the succubus could do nothing but watch her prize abscond beyond reach. As the redeemed murderer flew out of sight she screamed, "" how?!"" Amid the delicate sounds of angel wings and a heavenly chorus the succubus heard a reply. ""I melt in your mouth, not in your hands bitch.""",human,58h0wd,0,1476972553,0

"Life kicked me in the balls

I am a musician and recently got booked to play a music festival, one of the hilghts of my career. I played to one of the biggest crowds I have ever played to and at the end of the night I took a beautiful woman home. She proceeded to brake into her own home because the key wasnt working,then she opened the front door proclaiming ""it wasnt locked"". I became the guard rails for her stumbling terror as she nearly fell into everything on the way to her bedroom. A few minutes later she said she needed to use the toilet so I waited about 10 minutes that's when I felt the need to check on her. I found her asleep on the john I picked her up and herded her into her room.Five minutes later she went back to the bathroom I waited 10 or so minutes, and sure enough she was asleep in the bathroom this time sprawled out on the floor. I picked her up and herded her to her room. Yet once again she decided to use the bathroom ,but this time she came back. She finally got under the blanket and went to sleep,the next morning her first words were ""oh my God did we have sex"" I said ""no"", then her mother brought over her 3 year old who woke me up, but not her by opening the door and staring at us. A few minutes later I met her brother who asked me if she was awake and about 10 minutes later she got up. She wanted to get ice so I went to her parents house next door, her dad asked me if I had a beer and thought my name was Philip even though I said George. I got the whole BF treatment without even getting a kiss. The next few days I stayed over at her house the farthest I got was spooning or ""cuddling"" as she called it. The day after ""cuddling"" she accused me of just hanging out to bang her I told her ""If I would have been feeling more presidential i would have grabbed your pussy when you were drunk"".the next day she acted like she wanted to hang,but I never heard from her again. So my trip to play a festival was nearing its end it had it's up and downs but wasn't ready to stop going south.i later found out one band collected tips for every band made about $200 and kept all the money the venue gave for the bands. So I met a girl walked away with nothing but story and I got ripped off,but wait there's more I did leave with somthing I got a hernia and it feels as if life kicked me in the balls.",human,cjob8r,0,1564471654,0

"There once was a man named Micheal Enrique Xavier, but everyone called him Mex

Mex was a very smart man. He excelled in school, and befriended everyone he met. He played the viola, and he was always first chair at every concert. At graduation, no one was surprised when we has the valedictorian of all of his classes, but everyone was proud of him. Mex was offered a full ride scholarship to Yale, and instantly fit in. He was never late to any of his classes, and always studied for absolutely everything. He graduated with a Bachelor's in Engineering and got a home in Southern Texas. He was driving home from a job interview when we noticed a group of construction workers at a house trying to put up a wall. He slowed down and rolled down his window. ""You fellas need any help?"" Mex spent the next few hours helping them with a section of the house. He told them how he could down and help them out from time to time. They told him that'd be awesome, and he started going back to the site a few days every week. They all became great friends. A few weeks later, the big boss of the project, Trevor Shump, came to check up. Everyone called him *the Trump*, because he was a nasty, grumpy businessman. They were all on break, when Trevor stormed in. ""Who the hell is that?"" ""This?"" One of the workers said. ""This is Mex. He went to college for engineering, and has been helping us out for a few--"" ""I don't *care*. Get him OFF my site!"" All the workers turned to Trevor. ""No way! He's awesome!"" ""You know what *isn't*? Why aren't these walls up?"" Another worker spoke up. ""You told us to wait for your inspection before working on the walls!"" ""God, you all are useless!""

"Mordred's hidden power

King Arthur has lately been very fond of Morgause. News has it that she bore him a son which was named Mordred, not thinking about the repercussions it might bring to his kingdom. On the other hand, the G brothers (Morgause's sons to her husband Lot) weren't very fond of their mother's incest-begotten son. Yeaes have passed, the brothers wanted to get rid of Mordred. However, it was very unhonorable for a knight to kill a boy who can't defend himself. The brothers then waited for Mordred to become a knight himself. When he became a full-fledged knight in service of King Arthur, the brothers came up with a plan. One of them is to challenge Mordred to a duel, and would dismiss his death as an accident while sparring. The brothers agreed that this is a foolproof plan, as Mordred seemed weaker than any of them, but boy were they in for a surprise. It was Gaheris who challenged him. After exchanging a couple of blows, it seemed like Mordred changed his weapon and armor in the blink of an eye, countering his arsenal. With this new weapon and armor, Gaheris knew that he can't possibly defeat Mordred now. Aggravayne challenged him next, and the same thing happened during their battle. Mordred's armor and weapon changed in the middle of the battle, and his greatsword became useless. As he fell on his knees, he came up with a better plan. He warned his brothers about this power, and that they should challenge him 2 on 1. No longer wanting to further taint their family's honor, Gawain and Gareth challenged Mordred 2 on 1 to get rid of him for good. They expected him turn down this challenge, but he obliged. They thought that they have the upper hand as there are two of them, but they underestimated Mordred's power. In less than a second, his armor hardened that not even a diamond can scratch it. Their swords broke as they clashed with Mordred's. Hopeless, the 2 of them surrendered and asked Mordred about his ability. Mordred, with the most impish grin he can muster, simply told them: ""Does it ever drive you crazy just how fast the knight changes?""",human,6p0uv5,0,1500809688,0

"There was a groundbreaking surgery performed here in Houston, TX.

A baby was born recently that had a congenital condition that caused problems with the development of the delicate tissues on his face. The poor child was born without eyelids. Resourceful doctors and surgeons came up with a plan to circumcise the baby boy and use his foreskin to construct new eyelids, which a talented local plastic surgeon then attached to the existing tissue around his eyes. They can't say for sure how functional the new eyelids will be later in life, but for now the surgery appears to be a huge success, and constant lubrication of his eyes is no longer necessary.

"An out of work pianist with Tourette's Syndrome was strolling around the streets...

An out of work pianist with Tourette's Syndrome was strolling around the streets and bars of Soho one sunny afternoon. Walking down Dean Street he sees a lounge bar with a sign in the window: 'Pianist wanted for evening performances'. ""Fucking get in there you cunt!"" he says to himself and goes to the bar. ""Get the fucking manager of this pigshit middle class wank pit please you cock sucking cunt"", he says to a somewhat startled barman. The barman however obliges and his manager comes upstairs. ""Can I help you sir?' he says. ""Yes you can you fucking fat assed piece of shit, I saw your shitty advert in the cunting window and I'm here to fucking audition. Wanker!"" The manager is naturally a little put off by the man's abrasive manner but his dire need for a top class pianist forces him to agree to an audition. The first tune the pianist plays is an uplifting jazzy number, not too involving, yet utterly melodic. At the end the thrilled barman cries, ""Wonderful! Wonderful! What was that called?"" ""That song, you big nosed fucking twat, was called 'Excuse Me Prime Minister But I Just Spunked In Your Fucking Daughter's Eye, And Now The Cunt's Blind.' "" ""Oh"" says the manager, somewhat taken aback, ""err, can you play me another? Something a little less lively maybe?"" ""Fucking wanker..."" interjects the pianist before launching into a powerful ballad of such beauty that it leaves the manager in tears. The manager, through his teardrops asks him the title. ""That little number was called 'Sometimes When You Fuck A Bird Up The Shit Box You Get Crap On Your Bell End.' "" ""I see"" says the manager. ""Have you got any songs with less offensive titles?"" ""Well there's my jazz number 'Do You Want Me To Spit In Your Ringpiece', or there's the epic 'I Don't Give A Fuck If You're Older My Dear, You've Still Got Fucking Cracking Jugs' "". ""Look,"" says the manager, ""I think you're a superb pianist but the title of your songs are a little dodgy, to say the least. I will hire you on the condition that you do not introduce your songs or speak to the audience."" ""Fuck it"", says the pianist, ""why cunting not?"" On his first night everything is going superbly and the crowd are lapping up his repertoire and his silence is simply being received as modesty. The only thing putting off the pianist is that in the front row there is a gorgeous blonde in a black evening dress with a split up the side revealing the tops of her stockings, and a plunging neckline which boasts a proud and inviting cleavage. During the interval the pianist has got such a stonking hard-on that he decides to go to the bog and knock one out. Just as he has shot his load he hears himself being re-introduced over the sound system, so he rushes back to the stage to finish his act. After the show he is at the bar relaxing when the same blonde approaches him. ""Hi"" she says. ""Oh, hello"" he winces, struggling to hold in the expletives. She leans over and whispers in his ear, ""Do you know your cock is hanging out of your trousers and spunk is dribbling onto your shoes?"" Placing his beer confidently on the bar, the pianist grins, looks her square in the eye and says, ""Know it? I fucking wrote it!!""",human,5qjvqr,59,1485553020,0

"Some tidbits for your pleasure

I'm wearing the boxers with the little hearts all over them tonight.... It's probably not a good night to go to jail. Getting married at 22 sounds a lot like leaving a party at 9:30pm. Probably should not have driven home from the bar last night.. especially considering I walked there. For once I would like to find a babysitter that doesn't get all upset when she gets to my house and realizes I don't have kids. I'm not saying women are smarter than men, but its kinda ironic that there's so few known women serial killers and so many unsolved murders. My boss just farted. I asked him if he was trying to get the condom out. He's mad now. Apparently, when your boss asks you to get a cake for a coworker's 60th birthday, 'cake' is not necessarily code for 'stripper.' And apparently you can't get a sick leave just because you're sick of seeing everyone at the office. My resume is really just a list of things I never want to do again. My girlfriend left me for a hindu guy. Anyway, he'll treat her better - they worship cows. how much morning wood, would my girlfriend suck, if she ever sucked and if I had a girlfriend. Whatever. I never try to make guests feel at home. If they wanted to feel at home, they should have stayed there. My wife is playing hard to get. Rid of. Great! I just wet my pants. Now people are gonna think I spilled a drink on myself. My insurance does not cover Jesus taking the wheel. I checked. The noblest of dogs is the hot dog, it feeds the hand that bites it. Today I bought cupcakes without sprinkles. Diets are hard. I wish all my younger siblings would appreciate how low I set the bar for them. I just wrote a check for 6 dollars, so I don't really wanna hear about your 'summer' house. I told my Mom that I was going to the Apple store and she said, ""You sound like you're 4 - it's the grocery store"".

"A horse is sitting at home watching MTV....

This was back when MTV played music videos. So, he's watching a heavy metal music video, and the guitarist plays an amazing solo. The horse says ""that looks amazing, I want to do that!"" The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse. ""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started."" ""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse."" ""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time."" Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken. ""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that."" Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken. ""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started."" ""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken."" ""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens.

They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar. Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow. ""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started."" ""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow."" ""Not to worry,"" the man says.

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital. Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors. Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death. So the horse walks into a bar.

Don't worry, our generous abbey will pay for you."" ""Uhm... Okay, deal"" Two months have passed and ten monasteries were indeed built in ten different countries. The next day, the journalist went back to the abbey. ""Am I a monk now?"" ""Not yet. You have to help 1,000 families in Africa by finding them a home and a steady income."" ""DAM- I mean, yeah, piece of cake."" It took the journalist three months to help all the families. Exhausted, he rushed back to the abbey. ""Tell me, am I finally a monk?!""

The other week I was in the aquarium having a whale of a time (pardon the pun). I saw sea horses, sharks, turtles, the whole shebang. But I couldn't wait to get to my favourite creature. I don't know why but I've always been fascinated by eels. I did a project on them in primary school and since then they've just stuck with me. I can name every single breed of them without even trying.\n \nSo I get to the eel section which is crowded beyond belief. I mean I love eels but most people just kind of glance at them on the way to the stingrays. Today there were so many people there I couldn't even see the tank. I managed to push myself to the front, accidentally shoving a toddler, and saw what all the fuss was about. \n\nThere they were, all swimming about, hidingin crevices, doing what eels do best. Except one. I couldn't actually believe it but right in the middle of the tank there was an eel. Biggest eel in there. And it was singing. Clear as day it was singing. I don't know how we were all hearing it through the glass and the water but we could see its mouth moving perfectly with the words. It even hummed some of the music at one point so I know it wasn't a trick. It only sang the one song though, this old love song that I can't remember the name of. It's really popular though,used in loads of movies, especially ones about Italy. \n\nI couldn't believe it, I'd never seen an eel do this before. I knew so much about eels and yet I'd never heard of this kind before. I managed to spot an employee on the other side of the room and struggled my way over. I somehow got his attention over the noise of all the people and the singing eel. \n\n\""How the hell does an eel know that song? How is it able to sing? What kind of eel is it?\"" And he turned to me and went \""oh that's a moray\""",ai,ai_9123,0,0,1

"The Clown Joke (WARNING: Very Long)

Once upon a time – which is a terrible way to start a joke – there was a little boy named Billy. Billy was six years old, and for the whole of his short life, he had been utterly and intensely obsessed with clowns. He had clown bed sheets and clown posters; he had clown toys and clown-themed games; he had towels with clowns on them, a toothbrush in the shape of a clown, and – if it had existed – he probably would have used clown-flavored toothpaste, as well. Try not to think about it. The point here is that Billy loved clowns, and his parents were well aware of that fact. (They'd have to be, right? I mean, how is a six-year-old going to buy all of that stuff on his own?) Thus, they decided that for their son's seventh birthday, they'd purchase front-row seats at the circus, which *just happened* to be in town at the same time. Upon hearing this, Billy was absolutely overcome with excitement, and he was scarcely able to sit still until his family arrived at the big top. Billy and his parents walked in, took their seats, and waited for the show to start. The music flared to life and the lights came up, and in a dazzling display of merriment, everything began. First came the lion-tamers with their whips and chairs... and yeah, they were intriguing, but they didn't hold Billy's interest. Next came the feats of strength with strongmen (and one excessively suspicious woman) smashing bricks and bending bars... and yeah, it was impressive, but Billy didn't really care. The sword swallowers followed, and the trapeze artists, and the tightrope walkers... and yeah, someone might have died at any moment, but it all seemed so *boring*. Eventually, Billy began to worry that he wouldn't get to see clowns at the circus. After all, he knew very well that clowns usually only appeared when something went wrong. (You didn't know that, did you? Yeah, clowns are typically kept on standby in case someone screws up.) Suddenly, all of the lights went out. A single spotlight shown down to one corner of the arena. A tiny car came puttering into view, while discordant, almost forlorn circus music played. *Deet deet deedle-deedle deet deet dee deeeeee...* The car's doors sprang open, and out poured the most amazing collection of clowns that Billy had ever seen! There were fat clowns, thin clowns, tall clowns, short clowns! Clowns with bright red hair and enormous red noses! Clowns in silly suspenders and oversize shoes! There were clowns wearing every color of the rainbow, and clowns that moved like psychotic ferrets on speed! There were more clowns than Billy had ever *dreamed* of watching all at once! Then, just as it seemed like that tiny car couldn't produce a single soul more, another clown stepped out. He was too fat to be thin, yet too thin to be fat... but somehow wasn't average, either. He was too short too be tall, yet too tall to be short... but still managed to be both at once. He had pale, almost white skin – not the product of makeup – and deep, almost black, sunken eyes. He had a shock of bright red (and completely natural) hair, and a bulbous, equally red nose. Billy looked on with awe and wonder as he realized what he was seeing: This wasn't a person in makeup who was putting on an act; this was a *real clown*. The man – if indeed you could call him a man – reached into the front of his pants, wiggled his hand around for a little while, and pulled forth a bright silver microphone. After offering a conspiratorial wink to the audience, the clown cleared his throat... and his dry, raspy voice boomed out for everyone to hear: ""I need a volunteer!"" **[Continued](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3wmv58/the_clown_joke_warning_very_long/cxxdzc6)**...",human,3wmv58,128,1450002851,0

He pondered my response for a moment, and then asked, ""Why do they call it the War of 1812 if it was in 1936?"" ""It was a Black Operation. No one is supposed to know about it."" (This was beginning to be way too much fun!) ""DUDE! Really?"" he exclaimed. ""How did you get to do something that COOL?""

""Dude!!"" he was really getting excited about what he was hearing! ""That is seriously awesome! But, didn't you... kind of stand out?"" ""Not really. The other guys were all wearing white camouflage."" The moron nodded knowingly. ""Listen, man,"" I said in a very serious tone, ""You can't tell anyone about this. It's still 'top secret' and I shouldn't have said anything."" ""Yeah?"" he gave me that, 'don't threaten me' look. With a really hard look I said, ""You have a family, don't you? We wouldn't want anything to happen to them, would we?"" The guy gulped, left his basket where it was and fled through the door.

"The Last Ride

\""Congratulations! You can now handle this route on your own. Remember the company's protocol\"", Bobbie beamed as he finished assessing Dave's performance for Bus Service 13. \""Enjoy the night events following the route\"", Bobbie mischievously hinted at Dave, his junior who had just joined the company.\n\n\nToday, Dave steeled his nerves. He will be on his own, handling the midnight \""last bus\"" schedule for Service 13, a long but important service, as it serviced a massive industrial area. Of course it's a bustling service in the day, with workers to and fro. As part of regulation, the company has to operate the service even till midnight where there's usually no passengers. Oddly, his only assignment will be to drive this service at this timing, and nothing else. Noone else in the company was jealous of his work but Dave cast aside those thoughts.\n\n\nSatisfied with the initial inspection of the double-decker bus, he started on his journey from the depot. With only the scenes of forest edges flying by, he examined quiet roads and empty pathways but an eerie feeling crept up as he passed a dilapidated graveyard. The government planned to exhume the site to pave way for more industrial projects, or at least that was what he had read in the papers.\n\n\nApproaching the start of the industrial area, he wondered if there'll be anyone boarding the bus. As expected, there was noone in the multitude of bus-stops he passed. As the last few factories loomed before him, he noticed someone at a bus-stop.\n\n\nIt was an old lady, dressed simply in a white dress, her dishevelled hair blocking her face, but two things were apparent. She held out her hand flagging the bus but her eyes were transfixed on something above. Specifically, the upper deck of the bus.\n\n\nDave slowed down, feeling slightly nervous and as he approaches, the figure maintained her position but her gaze never strayed. Confident that the person was physically there, he stopped and the woman boarded, her face distraught.\n\n\n\""I have never seen so many people up there at this time, it must be because today's Friday the 13th\"", she shivered. Dave was dumbfounded as she took her seat beside the stairwell leading to the upper deck. Indeed today was Friday 13th as he eyed the woman through the rear view mirror. She was 5 seats away from him but her fear was contagious. Dave had goosebumps as he pulled off.\n\n\n\""I'm sorry madam, but what do you mean people up there? You're the first passenger\"", Dave inquired, trying to quench his curiousity.\n\n\n\""Nothing nothing! I can hear them stomping above as though they're trying to shush me\"", the woman squeaked as she clasped her hand in prayer.\n\n\nDave was mortified. He kept looking at the CCTV monitor panel but there was noone in the upper decks. His fear was somewhat relieved as they entered the residential zone and 13 stops later, the woman buzzed the stop. Dave couldn't believe his eyes when the woman ran fleeing out of the bus at her stop. Her face displayed pure agony as she turned back for the last time to look at the bus before disappearing into the shadows of the houses.\n\n\nDave controlled his breathing and continued driving. It was only a few stops away till the final depot, so he must see this journey to the end. Still, he kept peeking at the CCTV monitors to be sure but nothing happened as he ended his work for the day.\n\n\n\nDave didn't tell anyone what happened as he turned up for work the next day. Perhaps it was an anomaly, there was no point in looking like a mad man after just a day's work. He checked the bus and headed out for the journey.\n\n\nThe same start as yesterday and again at the same stop, there appeared the lady again. She looked the same, save for her change of clothes but still her gaze was transfixed on the upper deck.\n\n\n\""Today's less busy... but there's a hulking presence amongst them\"", she whispered as she sat further way from Dave, nearer the exit doors.\n\n\nChill went down his spine. Was there a murderous intent above that he didn't notice? He scanned the monitors just to be safe but he couldn't see anything. Even Dave who didn't believe in the supernatural, was starting to question his beliefs, as he noticed the woman sobbing in her seat.\n\n\nAs if a replay of last night's activities, the woman sprung out and ran when they reached her stop. She didn't even look back.\n\n\nThese series of events repeated themselves as Dave drove the service for more than a year. He thought he could get used to it but he just couldn't. Different nights, different terrors. It has gotten to the point that the woman now regularly sat on the exit door steps, clutching to the walls, sniffling her cries.\n\n\n\""There's something on the roof\"", \""I can hear them trying to go down the stairwells\"", \""Stop looking into the upper deck, they're restless\"", \""We're damned in this service\"", \""I hope you're praying as hard as me, it's the only way to resist\"", \""Stop crying and wailing, stop! Stop, I can't help you!!!\"", \""God bless me please!\"", all manners of horrified speeches were said by the woman, either directed to him or to the dwelling above.\n\n\n\n\""I pray you are safe!\"", \""God bless your soul\"", \""Be safe\"", sometimes she would say that to Dave before she alighted. Dave hated it when she said parting words because it hinted a terrifying presence.\n\n\nAnd then one day it stopped.\n\n\nThe lady stopped appearing.\n\n\nThe same day the government had also begun exhuming the sites and transferring the remains to another mortuary.\n\n\nDave rue the day he started noticing her absence. She was the only company he had in this damned service route.\n\n\nHe kept checking the CCTV above, afraid of the unknown. He started praying from the moment he start the journey. He brought books of faith, talisman, charms and even turned to vegetarian diet to rid himself of bad karma. But whatever he did, the pressure behind him grew and grew. \n\n\nWithout the woman, things had started to go awry. He didn't notice them at first but he thought he could start seeing the negativities himself. Flickers in the CCTV monitor, he felt the temperature drop, opposing cars high beamed him, and it started to affect his driving. He would narrowly avoid collision with structures while checking the monitors. He would unconciously speed up and beat red lights when in the vicinity of the violated graveyard.\n\n\n2 months of this has taken a toll on Dave. He had nightmares every night, images of dark shadows consuming the interior of the bus. In just the short period, Dave had lost a lot of weight, he looked gaunt and his eyes lifeless. His concerned wife pulled him aside and just said she loved him, their children loved him, and if work was the reason he had become like this, he should find another job.\n\n\nDave spent the morning thinking about this. The job paid well since it was night hours, it was only 1 route and he had never fell ill in the past year, despite his horror experiences. It was only after the lady disappeared that things have taken a physical toll on him. He concluded that she was part of his divine protection. He had made up his mind. He will tender his resignation.\n\n\n\nIn front of his superiors, Dave explained his reasons for quitting. He didn't care if they didn't believed him, and he even turned down their offer for a raise. They must know something, that must be why they want to keep me. Without anyone else wanting to run the midnight bus service 13, the company could face a legal repercussion. In the end, they had to call back Bobbie, the only person who had drove that route before Dave. In fact, Bobbie drove exclusively that route for more than a decade, never taking a day off.\n\n\nDave took his leave and lo and behold, he met Bobbie outside the office. \n\n\nBobbie exlaimed his surprise, \""I heard you're resigning? But why?\""\n\n\n\""I couldn't continue working that route after the only passenger, this lady, I don't know anything about her, but after she stopped apeparing, I just don't have the will to continue\"", Dave said.\n\n\n\""That's... a damn shame! She was the only reason why I had agreed to come back! My ailing eyesight was why the company transferred me to day shift. But if I had a choice, I would have stayed on service 13! But now that she's gone... it's all over\"", Bobbie wept.\n\n\nBobbie continued hopelessly, \""Now who's gonna accompany me in that night ride...\"".\n\n\n\""I understand what you meant Bobbie. In hindsight, she was also the reason why I stayed. She was my protector, my guardian angel\"", Dave sighed.\n\n\n\""What the fuck are you talking about?\"", quizzed Bobbie suddenly.\n\n\nDave told his stories to a bewildered Bobbie, who kept quiet the whole time.\n\n\n\""That foxy vixen... I guess she must have retired from her company\"" mumbled Bobbie.\n\n\nNoticing the shocked look plastered on Dave's face.\n\n\nBobbie chuckled, \""I guess she'll really do anything to avoid paying the bus fare\"".",ai,ai_4210,0,0,1

The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building! So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads: Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids. 'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more..' So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads: Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking. 'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads: Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework. 'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!' Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak. She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads: Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. PLEASE NOTE: To avoid bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street. The First floor -has wives that love sex. The Second floor - has wives that love sex and have money and like beer. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited",human,7hzlc9,89,1512581525,0
"So I went to Japan on holiday,

and I had a very close online Japanese friend I met on a Guitar Hero forum, and we arranged to meet up. I thought he was a guy, but then this really cute girl with short, brown hair shows up, easily a 9/10. She's called Nao and even though it's the first time we had met in real life, we get along really well. She tells me that she pretended to be a guy online because she wanted to talk with someone about rock music but that people wouldn't take her seriously because she was a girl. She apologised, and I said that I'd accept her apology on one condition – that she plays guitar hero with me. She laughed and agreed – she had a great smile – and we went to her apartment. She hurriedly opened her PS4 and accessed guitar hero. She was a pretty high level, much higher than I was, but we played anyway. Somehow I won – I guess I just got lucky, but she turned off the game and started sulking, and didn't speak to me for a while. I didn't want our meetup to end like this, so I tried to motivate her: ""Hey Nao, you're a rockstar. Get your game on, go, play...""",human,d8zh2m,32,1569393219,0

"[Long] A guy wanted to lose weight

There's a guy. We'll call him Bob. Bob is a fat slob, but one day decides that he's going to turn things around and start getting in shape. So he sees an ad for a new workout program, and calls the number. The operator agrees to start him off with a one-month trial of their lowest level program, and tells Bob to be ready to go running first thing in the morning, and someone will be out to his house.\n\nSo first thing in the morning, hes all dressed and ready, and hears a knock on the door. He opens the door and sees the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. Just eye-poppingly gorgeous. She's wearing a T-shirt that reads \""If you catch me, you can have me\"". And without a word, she takes off running.\n\nWell Bob takes off after her. He chases her several blocks before he's just to tired to continue and collapses on the pavement. After a bit to catch his breath, he gets up and realizes she's long gone, and he doesn't even know which way she went, so he just has to go home.\n\nThe next day, there's another knock on his door. Same girl, same T-shirt, same drill as before. He still doesn't catch her, but he gets a few blocks farther before he's forced to stop. This process is repeated for the whole month, and while Bob never manages to catch up to her, he does lose a lot of weight trying.\n\nAfter the last session, he gets a phone call from the program, asking how his trial month went, and if he'd like to try the next-level program. It's a more strenuous program, not for the faint of heart, but if Bob wants to give it a go, they'll let him try it. Bob, decides to give it a shot.\n\nNext morning, there's a knock on the door. It's a new girl with the same T-shirt, so beautiful that she makes the previous one look like a snaggle-toothed hag by comparison. The sort of woman Bob didn't even think could really exists. She flashes him a quick smile that makes his heart melt and takes off running even faster than the first girl. Bob chases after her even harder and more determined than before, and manages to keep up with her for several miles before falling out. Like before, this continues on for the whole month, Bob getting more in shape and managing to run further and faster each time.\n\nThe last day of the month comes by, and Bob is ready and waiting. By this time, he's a lean, mean running machine. He gets up before dawn to warm up and stretch, eat a good breakfast, and make sure he's well hydrated. So when that knock on the door comes, it's off to the races.\n\nThe girl takes off at a dead sprint, but Bob follows right on her heels. She runs up and down every street in town, mile after mile, juking and weaving and doing everything she can to lose Bob, but Bob is in shape now and keeps right on her heels. All day he chases her around town, and then, after running a virtual marathon around town, he finally catches her, and he has her.\n\nSo Bob is feeling pretty good about himself now. He's gone from a fat slob that no woman would give the time of day to to a stud that's banging supermodels. But he wonders if this is really as far as he can go. So he calls up the number and asks if there's any other programs. The salesman hesitates before answering, then tells him that yes, they do have one more level of program, but it's only for the *most* dedicated clients and he doesn't really think it's suitable for Bob. But Bob is pretty self-confident now, so he insists. After a while, he eventually gets the salesman to relent sign him up for the top level program.\n\nMorning comes, and Bob hears a knock on the door. Given that he'd thought the first girl was practically a perfect 10, and the second one was even better, he's anxious to see what the best one looks like. He opens the door, and sees a gigantic brute of a man, at least seven feet tall and sporting what looks like 300 pounds of pure muscle. The brute has a cruel smirk on his face that makes Bob's blood freeze in is veins, and is staring directly at Bob the way a lion stares at a wounded zebra.\n\nBob looks at the man's T-shirt, which reads \""If I catch you, I get to keep you\"".",ai,ai_5863,0,0,1

A Cowboy sitting in a saloon one Saturday night recognized an elderly man standing at the bar who in his day had the reputation of being the fastest gun in the West.

"The Mexican president has a rare cancer of the brain and is in need of a brain transplant. His only option is a risky new procedure that his doctor recently perfected.

He now has to “shop” for his brain. “Sir, as this is a new procedure, our pool of brains you can choose from is rather small. Prices of the brains will vary,” said the doctor. “Okay, show me what you’ve got. I have an important job, so I’ll need the best brain,” replies the president. “A South Korean brain will cost you $80,000.” The Mexican president widens his eyes in shock at the price. But then thinks that yes, the Koreans are smart people. It is quite understandable that a brain from there would be costly. “A brain from China would cost $15.000,” the doc continued, “an American one would cost $2,500, and las-“ “HAH!” The president interrupted. “And those dumb Americans are always looking down on us. Look at their cheap ass brains!” The Mexican president smirks to himself. “As I was saying,” continued the doctor, “ lastly, a Mexican brain would cost $150,000.” Immediately, the president’s chest swells with pride, thinking what great minds his country has. “I’ll take the Mexican brain!” He exclaims, almost with a tear in his eye. After the operation, when the president is recovering, he begins to wonder and asks how the brains were priced. “Ah, you see, China has no shortage of brains from people getting terminated for unknown reasons. However, censorship and propaganda limits and degrades the brain somewhat. Hence the lower price. The Americans gorge their minds on social media, low quality entertainment and useless things like conspiracy theories. This combination really harms their brains, and the nonsense their president spouts also exacerbates this,” the doc adds with a slight smile. “What about Mexican brains? They’re the most expensive and therefore the best, right?” “Yes. They are the freshest minds with the most potential because most of them have never been used and are good as new.”",human,aon334,14,1549672274,0

Would you like to try it?"" The guy thinks about it and says, ""Well, the thought of going through life without being able to have sex is just too much for me. What have I got to lose? Let's do it.""

A man goes to a doctor claiming his speech impediment is effecting his life, no one will hire him, no females will talk to him, no one wants to be his friend because of the way he talks and something needs to be done. The doctor curiously looks into the situation. “Turns out your penis is too large and it’s pulling on your vocal chords sir, we can remove 9” of it and it should clear your problems speaking”, says the doctor. Flabbergasted, the man storms out of the doctors office in a huff. “Thh..th..the hell wih..wihh..with thaa Doctor.. i.. i.. need mm.mmmore th..than fuh.. four inches“ Years go by, and opportunity after opportunity seem to pass by because of his problem speaking, the man decides to undergo the surgery and contacts the doctor.

All the things he thought to be missing out on in life are happening around him.. BUT!! there’s this new regret building fast in the pit of his mind. “I miss my big cock terribly, my girlfriend craves passion, my confidence is starting to fade. I need to change things and get my cock back” he remorsefully said to him self as he heads to the doctors. He storms into the doctors office demanding his penis be re-lengthened. “Doctor change my penis back at once. I don’t care about the speech impediment I want my lonely life back with my big cock!!”.

"Once upon a time...

A horse lived on a farm with a pig, a sheep, and a cow. Now these were no ordinary barnyard animals - for they were bestowed the miracle of Disney animal anthropomorphism - subsequently, the farmer was very happy to have these animals in his posession and the people who came afar to see them made him a very wealthy man. One day, the farmer's child leaves his guitar outside as his mother calls him for dinner. Curiously, the gang of animals approaches the instrument. The pig picks it up and strums tentatively trying to mimic what he saw the boy doing. He finds that he is a natural and when the farmer hears - he instantly sees the business potential. So the very next day, the farmer buys a drum-set, bass and another guitar and hands one to each of the animals. The horse himself took a liking to guitar whilst the sheep took the drums, leaving the cow on bass guitar. By sheer narrative convenience, all the animals showed prodigious skill at their respective instruments and became proficient players very quickly. The horse, with his gravelly melancholic voice assumed the role of vocalist. Their first gig was a roaring success and set them on the road for superstardom. It turned out that the saturated music market had a niche for a band of rock playing animals. Within weeks, they had released their first album and planned on doing a world tour. Tickets at every destination sell out almost instantly. The first half of their tour was uneventful, however, the horse - not used to the pressures of being a celebrity- began to use alcohol as escapism. He told himself he was in control but the other bandmembers noticed his problem and grew increasingly worried for the horse. One fateful night, the tourbus loses control on the tarmac and slips off the road into a sharp valley - everybody is killed but the horse. He stumbles out of the wreckage and begins searching for his friends and every corpse he stumbles across breaks him even more. The funeral was a dull affair and despite their stardom, few people turned up. The horse wept bitterly for his friends who he thought deserved a better farewell. Turning and leaving the procession, he wanders aimlessly into the city. Day quickly turns into night and a storm approaches. The horse hears the thunder in the distance, but he keeps walking like a man without cause. As the first drop begin to fall, the horse spies the neon lights of a bar which promise a warm refuge away from the rain and more importantly, his grief. So, the horse walks into the bar and the bartender asks, ""Why the long face?""",human,6iwa54,250,1498163613,0
"A grumpy, drunken, old cowboy was riding his horse near the Mexican border when he noticed it chewing on a strange, stout cactus.

Before long, the pony started behaving strangely, walking slowly and irregularly and not responding to the cowboys commands. The cowboy became progressively more frustrated, as well as more drunk and more mean as he continued to glug himself into the depths of his whiskey bottle. The horse eventually came to a complete halt near a campfire where a young mexican man was picking a melancholy tune on the guitar. It pricked its ears and began swaying gently to the melody, seemingly oblivious to the slurred ranting and furious kicking from the inebriated cowboy on its back. The mexican looked up from his strings to see the severely drunken cowboy barely holding onto his stirrups and swinging dangerously on the saddle as he tried to kick his wide -pupiled, glassy-eyed animal, cursing the horse for its stupidity and laziness. ""Hey man"" he said. ""You really need to get off your high horse.""",human,f5y9pa,4,1582058104,0

OK, so this family walks into a talent agency, it’s a mother, father, their son and daughter, and a little baby. The father says to the talent agent, “Sir, our family has an amazing act, we know if you would let us perform it for you, you would want to sign us.” And the talent agent says, “Sorry, we don’t sign family acts, they’re too cutesy.” But then the mother goes, “Please sir, if you just give us two minutes I know you’ll like our act.” So the talent agent says “Alright, ya got two minutes.”\n\nSo the family jumps right into it. The mother smiles and points at the son who hits “play” on a boombox. Thrilling circus music starts to play as the father spins his daughter around, bends her over, lifts up her skirt, and starts licking her asshole. Then the son lays down on the floor and opens his mouth and the mother tears off tear-away pants, squats down over his face and starts shitting all over him. The father grabs the baby, takes off his diaper and starts sucking his cock. While the son, still with his mother’s shit in his mouth, goes over and licks the baby’s tiny little balls.\n\nNow the mother lays down on the floor while the daughter gets up high on a chair and starts pissing all over her. Then the father and son take the baby and start stuffing it head-first back into the mother’s vagina, while the daughter’s piss rains down on all of them.\n\nThey get the baby halfway in, so that just its legs are sticking out all flailing around. The son takes the mother’s shit out of his mouth and starts rubbing it all over everyone, while the father sticks his cock in the baby’s asshole and fucks it while it’s still inside the mother, until he comes all over the baby, the wife, the son and the daughter.\n\nThen the father gets up and says “And now for our impersonation of the victims of 9/11.” The whole family starts running around the room screaming and laughing with their dicks and titties all flapping around covered with shit and piss and cum going “Aaaaugh! Aaaugh! The building’s coming down! Help!”\n\nAnd finally the family runs back to the center of the room and goes “TA-DAAAA!!”\n\nAnd the talent agent he just sits there for the longest time, and finally he says, “Jesus, that’s a hell of an act.

He makes an appointment, flies to Switzerland, sees the doctor and gets examined up and down . . . they touch him, poke him, scan him . . . . they give him reflex tests and gagging tests and neurological tests and tests he has no idea what the purpose is. Finally, the doctor comes to him and says, “We have good news and bad news.” The man, thinking he must have a brain tumor or cancer responds, “Just tell me doc, what’s the bad news? How long do I got?” “No, you don’t understand,” the doctor says, “we can cure your headaches.” “You can!” the man exclaims, “that’s the best news in the world!!” But the doctor goes on, “to cure you, we need to castrate you.” The patient reflexively covers his genitals and says that he has to think about this. He flies home, but it is no use. The headaches are worse than ever. He can’t eat, he can’t sleep – he can’t have sex. Finally he calls the clinic and arranges for the procedure.
