She apologised, and I said that I'd accept her apology on one condition – that she plays guitar hero with me. \n\nShe laughed and agreed – she had a great smile – and we went to her apartment.

A horse lived on a farm with a pig, a sheep, and a cow. Now these were no ordinary barnyard animals - for they were bestowed the miracle of Disney animal anthropomorphism - subsequently, the farmer was very happy to have these animals in his posession and the people who came afar to see them made him a very wealthy man.\n\nOne day, the farmer's child leaves his guitar outside as his mother calls him for dinner. Curiously, the gang of animals approaches the instrument. The pig picks it up and strums tentatively trying to mimic what he saw the boy doing. He finds that he is a natural and when the farmer hears - he instantly sees the business potential. \n\nSo the very next day, the farmer buys a drum-set, bass and another guitar and hands one to each of the animals. The horse himself took a liking to guitar whilst the sheep took the drums, leaving the cow on bass guitar. By sheer narrative convenience, all the animals showed prodigious skill at their respective instruments and became proficient players very quickly. The horse, with his gravelly melancholic voice assumed the role of vocalist.\n\nTheir first gig was a roaring success and set them on the road for superstardom. It turned out that the saturated music market had a niche for a band of rock playing animals. Within weeks, they had released their first album and planned on doing a world tour. Tickets at every destination sell out almost instantly.\n\nThe first half of their tour was uneventful, however, the horse - not used to the pressures of being a celebrity- began to use alcohol as escapism. He told himself he was in control but the other bandmembers noticed his problem and grew increasingly worried for the horse. \n\nOne fateful night, the tourbus loses control on the tarmac and slips off the road into a sharp valley - everybody is killed but the horse. He stumbles out of the wreckage and begins searching for his friends and every corpse he stumbles across breaks him even more.\n\nThe funeral was a dull affair and despite their stardom, few people turned up. The horse wept bitterly for his friends who he thought deserved a better farewell. Turning and leaving the procession, he wanders aimlessly into the city. \n\nDay quickly turns into night and a storm approaches. The horse hears the thunder in the distance, but he keeps walking like a man without cause. As the first drop begin to fall, the horse spies the neon lights of a bar which promise a warm refuge away from the rain and more importantly, his grief.\n\nSo, the horse walks into the bar and the bartender asks, \""Why the long face?\""",ai,ai_5648,0,0,1,2615,2615,456,4.734649122807017,26

Two guys were flying in an airplane, over the deepest part of the jungle. Suddenly, their plane developed engine problems and they were forced to make a crash landing. After the crash, they gathered all the supplies they could carry and set off through the jungle towards the last town they flew over. When the men reached the town, it was nearly dark out. They instantly realized something was wrong. There were no modern buildings or vehicles. The only light came from scattered torches and fires. The most disturbing thing about the town was the lack of people... Until they noticed the heads decorating the huts. On every hut hung 4-5 severed heads, faces contorted in eternal agony. Only then did the men realize they'd stumbled into a town of cannibals. They began discussing what they should do, when out of the bushes sprang the cannibals. Dozens of savages, each with strange weapons and gruesome masks.!The men were terrified! Once the men were bound, they were brought before the Chief of the Cannibals. The Chief, who spoke passable English, informed the men of their fate: ""For violating our sacred mother jungle and trespassing in our village, you should be killed instantly! But we aren't mindless savages, as the outside world would have you believe. You will be given a choice: You can face our most feared warrior one-on-one... If you defeat him, you will be taken back to civilization. The second choice is to be killed in the manner of the others!"" The Chief waved a hand in the direction of the decapitated heads... The first man stepped forward and said, ""I will fight!"" Immediately, the cannibals started chanting... ""Oogah Boogah! Oogah Boogah!"" A giant cannibal emerged from the largest hut in the village. The savage, whose name was Oogah Boogah, stood over 9 feet tall and was 453lbs. of pure muscle. With fire in his eyes, he stomped over to the first man and began beating.

CIA: We can't do that. Trump: Why is that? CIA: India will cut Balochistan out of Pak. Trump: I don't care. CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons.

Let us start with the Saudis. Pentagon: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it. Trump: Then, let us invade Iran. Pentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.

CIA: We need the Shi'ite gov't of Iraq to keep ISIS in check. Trump: I am banning Muslims from entering US. FBI: We can't do that. Trump: Why not? FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.

"The Irish Spy

The CIA lost track of its operative in Ireland “Murphy. ” The CIA boss says, “All I can tell you is that his name is Murphy and that he’s somewhere in Ireland. If you think you’ve located him, tell him the code words, “The weather forecast calls for mist in the morning. ” If it’s really him, he’ll answer, “Yes, and for mist at noon as well. ” So the spy hunter goes to Ireland and stops in a bar in one of the small towns. He says to the bartender, “Maybe you can help me. I’m looking for a guy named Murphy. ” The bartender replies, “You’re going to have to be more specific because, around here, there are lots of guys named Murphy. There’s Murphy the Baker, who runs the pastry shop on the next block. There’s Murphy the Banker, who’s president of our local savings bank. There’s Murphy the Blacksmith, who works at the stables. And, as a matter of fact, my name is Murphy, too. ” Hearing this, the spy hunter figures he might as well try the code words on the bartender, so he says, “The weather forecast calls for mist in the morning. ” The bartender replies, “Oh, you’re looking for Murphy the Spy.

"Why did the chicken cross the road?

SARAH PALIN: The chicken crossed the road because, gosh-darn it, he's a maverick! BARACK OBAMA: Let me be perfectly clear, if the chickens like their eggs they can keep their eggs. No chicken will be required to cross the road to surrender her eggs. Period. JOHN McCAIN: My friends, the chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road. HILLARY CLINTON: What difference at this point does it make why the chicken crossed the road. GEORGE W. BUSH: We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either with us or against us. There is no middle ground here. DICK CHENEY: Where's my gun? COLIN POWELL: Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road. BILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken. AL GORE: I invented the chicken. JOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it. AL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white? DR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he is acting by not taking on his current problems before adding any new problems. OPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross the road so badly. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a NEW CAR so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens. ANDERSON COOPER: We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road. NANCY GRACE: That chicken crossed the road because he's guilty! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks. PAT BUCHANAN: To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American. MARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way the chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information. DR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told. ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die in the rain, alone. JERRY FALWELL: Because the chicken was gay! Can't you people see the plain truth? That's why they call it the 'other side.' Yes, my friends, that chicken was gay. If you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the Liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like 'the other side.' That chicken should not be crossing the road. It's as plain and as simple as that. GRANDPA: In my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us. BARBARA WALTERS: Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heart warming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish it's lifelong dream of crossing the road. ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road. JOHN LENNON: Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together, in peace. BILL GATES: I have just released eChicken2013, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken2013. This new platform is much more stable and will never reboot. ALBERT EINSTEIN: Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken? COLONEL SANDERS: Did I miss one?",human,3xv7kt,19,1450810850,0,4112,4112,762,4.396325459317585,43

"When my grandfather was a young boy living outside a small town in rural Kentucky

they didn't have much as way of entertainment except for fishing and hunting with his big shaggy dog, Bear. When he wasn't helping his parents out with chores, he spent most of his summers out in the forests camping with Bear, hunting squirrels and rabbits, or just fishing along the river. He'd wandered a bit further away one day than he normally did, and came across an old monastary with a congregation of friars. \n\nNow, this region of Kentucky wasn't very well off, so what a lot of the small town farmers did was take their goods in to the larger city to sell at farmers markets and to stores. The friars were no exception to this because while they didn't need much money, they did need some to buy food and clothes. When my grandfather came across that old monastary, he'd seen acre after acre of wide open meadows just full of wildflowers of every sort you could imagine. Big yellow flowers, little red and blue speckled flowers, daisies, queen's lace. The fields were alive with bees buzzing and humming birds humming, truly, it was a beautiful, inspiring sight. And out there, scattered throughout the meadows, the friars, each with a big woven basket filled to the brim with boquets they crafted by hand. These were what they would send in to town to be sold.\n\nMy great grandfather, that is, my grandpa's dad, worked for a man that lived in the city most of the local farmers would travel to to sell their produce. This man was a baron of sorts; he owned several businesses in town and he was always on the look out for a new business or property to invest in to grow his wealth. His name was Hugh, and he wasnt known for his huge, friendly demeanor. What he was known for was his ruthless and cunning sense of busines. Hugh never let anything get in his way when it came to growing his business. \n\nA year after my grandpa and Bear met the friars, a reporter came to town to photograph the festival they had every summer in town. This festival was the town's yearly highlight, at least as big a deal as Thanksgiving and nearly as big a deal as Easter and Christmas (which in those days made it a Very Big Deal indeed)! Every year for the festival the friars would supply the most stunning flower arrangements for the town's main street, through which the town would have a small parade with the mayor tossing candies for all the children, and men and women in costumes dancing along to music played by the school's small band. Folk from all around the town would journey in for the day, set up food stalls to sell pies and hot cakes, roast rabbit on toast and spicy squirrel stew. This year the festival was held in even higher anticipation because of the participation of the local fire department. They'd offered to lead the parade with a big red firetruck, and the firemen all dressed up in celebration. \n\nThe fire department's presence was as much for the celebration as it was for safety. The previous year an unfortunate accident had caused a large fire to catch and spread to the forest around the town. Several blocks of the town had been evacuated before the fire was finally contained and put out, but not before some acres of the forest had burned down. But that event had gotten my grandpa's small town on the radar of the big city, and the local paper had decided to feature them in an article this particular summer! \n\nThe festival was a tremendous success! The food was fantastic, the parade was picturesque! The friars flower displays were the highlight of the night, and the photographer made sure to do them as much justice as he could. Truly, they were the talk of the festival, to the point that some weeks later at the next farmers market in the city, the friars sold out of their boquets in the first hour of the morning! Word had spread, pardon the pun, like a fire, and everyone wanted to buy the friars flowers!\n\nEven old Hugh had seen and heard word of the sudden popularity of these boquets and went down to the market to see for himself. He stood, mouth agape, as a crowed massed around the floral displays, pushing to be the next to buy before the flowers were all gone. Much to the dismay of the friars, their newfound popularity lead to incredible new demand. And though they did try to prepare more boquets for the market, they were realy selling more than they'd ever intended. For while the did it for a little money to afford necessiries, for the friars, spreading beauty and peace with their flowers was more than enough in return.\n\nWhen Hugh saw the potential in the popularity of the flowers the friars grew, his mind immediately started working on a way to turn it to his benefit. He waited for the crowds to finally die down and went to speak to the holy men. \n\n\""I'd like to make you an offer,\"" Hugh said. \""Your beautiful flowers are the talk of the town. I'd like to help you out by handling all the sales of the flowers for you, for a small cut of the profit! That way, you can focus on growing and creating your wonderful boquets, without worrying about the hassle and bother of coming into the market each week and dealing with the crowds!\""\n\nThe friars thanked Hugh for his offer, but they explained to him that for them, the boquets were not just a business endeavor, it was their service to the community to spread peace and joy with God's flowers and blessings. And with that, the friars packed up and started the journey back to their monastary.\n\nWell, Hugh was not satisfied at all with that answer, and he came up with a plan. Over the next few weeks he ordered crate after craft of exotic flowers from all around the world. Beautiful flowers from Morocco to France, stunning petals from China to India. Anything colorful and amazing that he could learn about. He set up a large shop just down the road from the Farmer's market where the Friars had their stall, and he called it The Festival Flourist and Fantastic Flowers. At first, the town was abuzz with these new and wonderful flowers, but after a few weeks, as the novelty wore off, the sales declined and soon Hugh's shop was empty. \n\nFor some reason he couldn't figure out, though, the friars were doing as well as ever! Week in and out, lines down the street would stand patiently waiting for the friars flowers. And cunning as he was, Hugh would not rest until he'd made his new business a success. \n\nA year or so later, my grandpa was on another fishing adventure with Bear, just following allong with stream, sometimes wading through the shallower parts of the water, othertimes dropping in a line and resting in the shade of a tree, when he saw thick, black smoke rising above the forest. Curious as any young boy would be, he set off at a run through the trees, heading towards the smoke. \n\nWhen he reached a large open meadow, a devastating sight lay before him: dozens of friars with brooms and small buckets were frantically working through the flower meadows tyring their best to fight thick, hot flames that were scorching along the ground! Some how, all the flower meadows had caught fire, and try as they might, nothing the friars could do was stopping the flames. \n\nThe fire department was evnetually contacted and they made it out to the monastary before too much of the forest had burned down, but sadly all of the flowers in the meadows had been left a charred, ruined mess. For the first time in years, the friars had no flowers to for the town's festival. Full of dismay, they sent word to the mayor that there was nothing they could do to salvage the flower displays for that year's parade, and whispers grew with worry that the festival that year might not live up to the town's hopes. \n\nIt was then that, just by hapenstance, Hugh visited town to meet with the mayor about opening a new business there in town. When he heard about the problems with the fire and the flowers, of course he'd be delighted to supply the town with all the flowers they could need, for a small fee. In the end, I'm afraid that there's no truly happy ending here: the Mayor accepted Hugh's flowers and his flower shop's popularity grew from then on. \n\nBut the moral of the story is this, my friends: \n\nHugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.",ai,ai_1233,0,0,1,8290,8290,1495,4.545150501672241,53

"In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana State University.

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day. Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man. Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly. Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant. This is for everyone who sends me those heart-warming bullshit stories.",human,5j4c02,149,1482119778,0,1747,1747,299,4.842809364548495,19

I can’t believe I actually wanted to make it to this height. Kicking pop music’s ass and taking the throne.

He called 911, the operator said it would take the fire department 30 minutes to get there.\n\nPanicking, he drove across the border, found the Mexican fire department and offered them $10,000 if they put out the fire.\n\nThe fire chief summoned his men, they all got on the fire truck and took off across the river at an amazing rate of speed. They got near the house and just kept going, they passed it up and turned back, eventually doing a big continuous doughnut around the house at 60 miles an hour! They turned on their hoses, sprayed the fire, and put the fire out.\n\nThe owner was so relived, he asked them what they were going to do with the money.\n\nThe Fire Chief replied \""The first thing I'm going to do is get those brakes fixed\""!",ai,ai_3378,0,0,1,871,871,159,4.477987421383648,8

"Double Whammy

So about a year and a half ago, I started dating a girl who loved to hear me play guitar. Her name was Alice, and probably her favorite song I played was Barracuda, and she was really into 80s music and culture. I really liked this girl and wanted to get serious, so I decided I wanted to get her something special for Christmas.\n\nI don't own any music on vinyl, except I did have the album Bad Animals by Heart (who wrote Barracuda), so I decided to give it to her. \n\nCue Christmas day, when I made time to go see her between family Christmas celebration so that I could give her the album as a present. I was so excited, but when she opened it, she looked a little underwhelmed. I guess I had amped up the present a little too much, because I could tell she didn't really like it.\n\nThat night my dad got a vinyl record player, and so he asked me if I had my heart album we could listen to it, but since we didn't have it, the only other album we could find was by one of my least favorite bands, Tears for Fears. It was an all around horrible day.\n\nThe next day, I found out that she had re-gifted it to her mom, and I was really upset. We got in a huge argument and eventually her mom felt bad enough that she gave me the album back.\n\nWe mended things and are doing all around a whole lot better than last year. This Christmas season is already going a lot better, and have decided to try and gift the album again, but this time to my cousin who is a little mentally handicapped.

"The Magic Dildo

A man is due on business trip for a few days. His wife, who is incredibly attractive and lustful, can't come with him so naturally he is worried about leaving her alone for a few days. So he goes to the local adult bookstore and says to the attendee, I need the best sex toy for women you have.\""\n\""Oh, you're gonna like this,\"" the clerk says as he brings out a black velvet box with a lock on it. \""This is The Magic Vibrator,\"" he says unlocking the box and presenting an average looking dildo. \""You tell this thing what to fuck, and it'll fly there and give'er hell until you say 'Magic Vibrator stop'.

"A wonderful homemade pun (VERY Long)

I decided not to add a TL;DR. If you've ever read the longest joke in the world, I'm guessing this might be right up near it, and might have the same effect. To get the full effect, I strongly reccomend you read the entire thing. Well, enough yapping, let's get started! So there’s this guy, walking around somewhere in India. He looks about sixty, his hair is just starting to gray. He’s walking down this really dirty street, with trash and mud everywhere. Here’s his story. His name is Abuk Chandrasekhar, but you can just call him Abuk. He is on his way home from a long, hard day at work. He’s about five minutes away from his tiny apartment. It is pouring down rain, the streets are nearly impossible to traverse across. After some struggle, Abuk is able to make it home safely. He takes off his dripping coat and muddy boots, then leans in close to his dingy kerosene heater. It’s no dinner again for the second night in a row; he’s about fed up with this hard life. But what can he do? If only he could somehow get to America, maybe life would be better. Abuk decides to sing away his troubles. Ever since he was a little boy, his mother and father encouraged him to sing. After twenty years of practice every night, he finally could sing beautifully, at least in his opinion. He has improved even more in the years after, and uses nearly all of his spare time to practice. Abuk falls asleep hours later, with dreams of singing in the far off land of America. The next morning, the weather clears up. He goes on his way to work as happy as can be. Up ahead, he sees disturbance in the street. a billboard. It’s brightly colored with very crisp edges just beginning to peel off. It says “AMERICAN IDOL - COMING TO NEW YORK CITY” in bold, thick text. Abuk’s face lights up right away. It must be a sign. He now knows where his life is going! Abuk turns around, rushes home, goes to his room, and grabs the small envelope that holds his entire life savings. He finds his phone, and dials the number for the local airport. “Hello, you’ve reached the Chennai International Airport, how may I help you?” the operator says in Hindi. “Hello, I was wondering how much a flight to New York would cost me.” “Our next flight to New York leaves in three days, and the price is... Hold on, let me check.... Fifty thousand rupees.” “Thank you” Abuk returns in English, hanging up the phone. Abuk counts his money. He has more than enough. “I’m going to America!” he exclaims ecstatically. Two days later, at the Chennai International Airport 0’600 hours Abuk steps out of the taxi, and pays the driver a generous tip. He hops out, grabs his bags, and happily jogs to the entrance. He quickly makes it through the light security, and heads directly for the plane. He tells everyone he can about his upcoming adventure to America. Most people keep walking without turning their heads, but at the gate Abuk meets someone who actually acknowledges him. The man who listens introduces himself as Aarav. He is traveling to America to meet his wife and child who flew up a few months earlier. He says he is the owner of a Jazz club, and invites Abuk to sing. “Oh, that sounds wonderful!” Abuk says, “After I finish the competition I will certainly come by to see you!” “Yes, very good, very good! I will see you later! May i have your phone number to call you?” “Sure, here.” Aarav pulls out his phone to write down the number. “91-365-447-3283.” “Thanks!” says Aarav. There is a buzz over the intercom, and the flight attendant starts announcing the first section. Abuk waves goodbye to his new acquaintance, and boards the plane. Abuk sits down right in the front of the plane so he can be the first one off. He stores his carry-on, and reclines his seat for the long, tiring flight ahead. Tomorrow he will be in America! The next day, in New York City. Noon Abuk strolls down the sidewalk, looking for the address listed on the billboard. The Al Hirschfeld theater. It isn’t hard to find, there’s a gigantic line of people out front. Camera crews walk up and down the crowds, people fighting for a shot in the camera. The auditions have already started! Abuk sprints to the back of the line. It takes nearly three hours of watching cars zoom past, planes fly overhead, lights flash, and the other hustling and bustling of the city before he makes it to the front. The bouncer calls his name, and he steps inside. Sitting in front of him are three judges: Steven Tyler, Simon Cowell, and Jennifer Lopez. “Oh, oh my gods! It is an honor to meet you!” Abuk says. I flew in all the way from india, and I’m here! “Oh, India! How wonderful!” Jennifer Lopez says, “I visited India many years ago. You have a beautiful country.” “Thank you, thank you!” Abuk says, “Today I will be singing Respect by Aretha Franklin. It is one of my favorites!” “Mine too, let’s hear it!” Steven Tyler returns. Abuk sings a wonderful solo, and gets all three votes to pass. He is going to Hollywood! Abuk runs out of the theater onto the streets, fist pumping and jumping for joy. In just two weeks, he will be appearing live on television in front of a huge studio audience! It seems his dream is going to come true! During the next few weeks, Abuk transfers his rupees to dollars, catches a transfer flight to Hollywood, and makes it to the theater with time to spare. He smashes his first performance, and makes it onto the semi finals unanimously. He goes around Hollywood, seeing everything he can, and just taking in the overwhelming rush of joy. He catches ANOTHER plane to the semifinals, and rocks Never Gonna Give You Up by rick Astley. After a few more weeks, he’s sitting at the finals, with two other people he’s competing against. His turn comes up faster than he would believe, and he attempts to sing the hardest song he’s ever had. Although he’s been practicing since the semifinals, he still doesn’t know if he can pull it off. His cover of Take on Me by A-Ha may be his biggest challenge yet. He dances to the techno music at the beginning, awing the crowd with his great moves. When the first line comes however, he misses his mark. He’s off by two seconds. His voice cracks, and his face turns bright red with embarrassment. He asks them to restart the track, but it’s too late. His final challenge is ruined. He failed. Tears stream down his face as he looked around the room, the audience dead silent. He slowly walks off stage. The next night, Abuk walks into the theater. The announcer comes on, and the three contestants line up. “The winner of American idol is... going to be announced after a quick commercial break.” The audience breaks out in laughter. Five minutes later, it happens for real. “America has voted. THE WINNER OF AMERICAN IDOL IS: ... ... ... ... ABUK CHANDRASEKHAR!!!” Abuk’s face is sad, he knows he’s lost. But after a few seconds his brain registers something. Did the announcer just say his name? HIS name? Abuk walks up to the front of the stage as confetti rains down from the ceiling. Tears stream down his face, but these are from joy, not sadness. He won the million dollars. America loved his other performances, and his mistake must have not been that bad! Yes! It just goes to show you, you never judge Abuk by his cover. _________ If you skipped ahead, SHAME ON YOU. Hope you enjoyed :D",human,60xdd8,39,1490216159,0,7347,7347,1337,4.495138369483919,107

A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate. When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards."" He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth..."" Suddenly, the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing.""",human,8w6s5z,61,1530755450,0,1020,1020,166,5.144578313253012,14

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery out in the country. As I was not familiar with the area, I got lost. I finally arrived an hour late and saw that the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play. The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I sang like I’ve never played before for this homeless man. As I sang & played “Amazing Grace”, the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished, I packed up my keyboard and started for my car.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I’ve never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.” Apparently, I’m still lost….",human,caetoy,80,1562549862,0,1285,1285,256,4.01953125,17

"Mbeki and his elephant

Mbeki was a boy who live in a small village on the edge of the great Serengeti plain of Africa. Mbeki would spend days watching the animals on the plain, learning and studying their behaviors. Twice a year during the great animal migration from their summer to their winter feeding grounds and back, the villagers would gather their meagre belongings and hide in caves in the hills above their village. When they returned, they would find that their village had been ravaged by marauding elephants that would strip the straw and logs from their mud huts for food. After one devastating year when the village was almost completely destroyed, Mbeki vowed to learn as much as he could about elephants to help his village. One day as he sat hidden in the tall grass he saw an old bull elephant with a broken tusk that appeared to be in distress. As Mbeki crawlled closer to observe, he noticed that the elephant was holding one foot off the ground. Mbeki crawed closer still and saw there was blood on the elephant's foot. Mbeki stood and approached the elephant nervously and saw a large thorn stuck beneath the elephant's foot. Screwing up his courage Mbeki held the elephant's foot in one hand and pulled at the thorn with all his might with his other hand. The thorn came loose at last, Mbeki gave a shout of triumph and the elephant gave a loud trumpet. Suddenly the elephant wrapped his trunk around Mbeki and lifted him high off the ground and Mbeki and the elephant looked at each other. Mbeki saw joy and thankfulness in the elephant's wise old eyes. After a long while the elephant gently placed Mbeki on the ground and stamped his front foot on the ground three times and slowly turned and walked away. After that day Mbeki vowed to double his efforts to learn all he could about the elephants. Soon he became famous for his knowledge throughout the land and was invited by neighbouring villages and cities and countries to talk about his experiences. Many years later, Mbeki now an old man after a long career travelling the world as the world's foremost expert on elephants finds himself back in the village he had lived as a child. But oh how it had grown, no longer a small dusty village of mud tracks and mud huts it was a modern city filled with all the trappings of modernity and a million people. It even had it's own zoo. Mbeki decides to visit. Mbeki walked around the animal enclosures smiling, remembering his life as a boy when suddenlh behind him he heard an elephant blow his trumpet.

"Touching funeral for homeless man

As a singer I sing at many funerals & I was recently asked by a funeral director to play & sing at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery out in the country. As I was not familiar with the area, I got lost. I finally arrived an hour late and saw that the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play. The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I sang like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.\n\nAs I sang & played “Amazing Grace”, the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished, I packed up my keyboard and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.\n\nAs I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I’ve never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.” Apparently, I’m still lost….",ai,ai_1937,0,0,1,1307,1307,255,4.125490196078432,17

"Four freshman partied too hard during a music festival and unable to make it back for their final exam the next day

As they drove back to the college, they tried to think of a good excuse. Finally, they agreed to the same story: a tire was blown in the middle of nowhere at mid night so they were stuck. They each sent the professor an email asking to retake the exam and gave the excuse. The understanding professor said it's fine and ask them to take it the next day, but for fairness they would have to take a different exam.\n\nThe next day they came to the exam room, and as per usual procedure, each obtained a copy of the exam and sat in a corner. The classroom was big and empty, the professor sat and watched them, so they were nervous. Fortunately, the questions on the first page are fairly easy. Even though these questions only worth 10/100 points, it calmed them down a bit. So they quickly finished the first page at the same time and turned to the second page.

"The daughter of a melon farmer and a travelling musician met one day and fell in love at first sight

The woman’s name was Angie, a beautiful, red-haired woman with a smile so magnetic and radiant one couldn’t help but fall head-over-heels; the musician’s name was Zachary, a strapping, young lad with flowing, blonde hair and broad shoulders, just wide enough to give him a powerful physique yet not intimidating in the slightest.\nThe two had met in a bar on a clear, starry night in the middle of July. The second Zachary had stepped in his gaze immediately met Angie’s. He approached her without a thought as to what he would say and had taken a seat mere inches from her. She turned to him, a gleam in her eyes as she introduced herself. “Good evening, the name’s Angie. How are you tonight?” A faint seductiveness in her voice sent a tingle down Zachary’s spine as he hurried. “Lovely weather we’re having, isn’t it?”\nNow, Zachary was always a fairly shy man. Despite his appearance he was never one for starting conversation and his fear was only elevated even more by the fact that Angie was by far the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.\nThe two talked some more throughout the night and eventually grew comfortable with one another. Despite her lifestyle Angie’s favourite genre of music had turned out to be soft-rock, which lo and behold Zachary was an artist in. “Why don’t you come to my concert? I’m playing tomorrow night at the theatre south of town and I’d love to have you there with me.”\nAngie had sprung on the offer, not wasting a second as she accepted with a great deal of enthusiasm. She gave him her address and phone number with a small note written on the bottom right: “pick me up at 10” with a heart drawn right next to it.\nThe next night Angie had waited for her parents to go to bed before going out to wait at her door for Zachary. Luckily, he’d arrived in the nick of time. “I’m on in an hour. If we hurry we can make it about 10 minutes early.”\nOnce the two had arrived Zachary led Angie backstage, telling her to wait for his call in order to find the best seat in the theatre to watch him play. Not five minutes passed once her phone buzzed, with the message “there’s a seat right in front of the mic stand, I got the set-up crew to reserve it for you.”\nOnce the concert had begun Zachary stepped up to the mic and looked right into Angie’s eyes while saying “this first song goes out to the most amazing woman I’ve ever had the chance of meeting.”\nThroughout the concert Angie’s eyes were glued to Zachary. She could feel herself falling deeper and deeper in love with him as he played, her beautiful, green eyes still stuck to his image long after the final song had been played.\nOnce backstage Angie had rushed toward her lover, locking lips with him and holding him as close to her as she could. Once the kiss had broken she jumped in place ecstatically, screaming in joy “that was the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen, Zachary! You were incredible out there!”\nThe drummer could be heard from the snack table, “I’m here, too, you know,” but to no avail.\nZachary led Angie to the side where he held her hands and gazed deeply into her eyes, and said to her:\n“Angie, I can’t stay here forever. I’m always travelling and I can’t just leave my life behind.”\nAngie’s eyes welled up as she fought to choke back tears.\n“Please, don’t cry. We can work around that.”\n“How?” Whispered Angie, her throat still sore from crying.\n“Come with me! We can travel the world together! You can leave this old melon business behind and we could be together!”\n“I...” Angie said to herself.\n“What is it?”\n“I don’t think that’s possible.”\n“Why not?” Now Zachary was starting to cry.\n“My father would never approve of it. He wants me to become a farmer just like him to keep the family business running.”\n“Angie, please,” begged Zachary. “I love you so much! I don’t want to leave you behind!”\n“I’m sorry, my dear,” cried Angie, wiping the tears from her cheek. “I cantaloupe.”",ai,ai_4064,0,0,1,4019,4019,712,4.644662921348314,41

Two guys were flying in an airplane, over the deepest part of the jungle. Suddenly, their plane developed engine problems and they were forced to make a crash landing. After the crash, they gathered all the supplies they could carry and set off through the jungle towards the last town they flew over.\n\nWhen the men reached the town, it was nearly dark out. They instantly realized something was wrong. There were no modern buildings or vehicles. The only light came from scattered torches and fires. The most disturbing thing about the town was the lack of people... \n\nUntil they noticed the heads decorating the huts. On every hut hung 4-5 severed heads, faces contorted in eternal agony. Only then did the men realize they'd stumbled into a town of cannibals.\n\nThey began discussing what they should do, when out of the bushes sprang the cannibals. Dozens of savages, each with strange weapons and gruesome masks.!The men were terrified!\n\nOnce the men were bound, they were brought before the Chief of the Cannibals. The Chief, who spoke passable English, informed the men of their fate:\n\n\""For violating our sacred mother jungle and trespassing in our village, you should be killed instantly! But we aren't mindless savages, as the outside world would have you believe. You will be given a choice: You can face our most feared warrior one-on-one... If you defeat him, you will be taken back to civilization. The second choice is to be killed in the manner of the others!\""\n\nThe Chief waved a hand in the direction of the decapitated heads...\n\nThe first man stepped forward and said, \""I will fight!\"" Immediately, the cannibals started chanting... \""Oogah Boogah! Oogah Boogah!\""\n\nA giant cannibal emerged from the largest hut in the village. The savage, whose name was Oogah Boogah, stood over 9 feet tall and was 453lbs. of pure muscle. With fire in his eyes, he stomped over to the first man and began beating.\n\nThe fight lasted less than 5 minutes. It ended with Oogah Boogah, who was quite aroused by the violence, having his way with the first man until he died. The second man was horrified!\n\nAfter the cheering died down, the Chief turned to the second man and asked for his choice. Without any delay, the man responded, \""Death! I choose death!\"" The Chief smiled broadly and held out his arms.\n\nThe cannibals began chanting, \""Death by Oogah Boogah!

"There was a groundbreaking surgery performed here in Houston, TX.

A baby was born recently that had a congenital condition that caused problems with the development of the delicate tissues on his face. The poor child was born without eyelids. Resourceful doctors and surgeons came up with a plan to circumcise the baby boy and use his foreskin to construct new eyelids, which a talented local plastic surgeon then attached to the existing tissue around his eyes. They can't say for sure how functional the new eyelids will be later in life, but for now the surgery appears to be a huge success, and constant lubrication of his eyes is no longer necessary. The only negative effect of the incredible operation is that now he's a little cock-eyed.",human,61zy9s,7,1490714251,0,746,746,128,4.828125,6

"Dear Tech Support

* Dear Tech Support, Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a distinct slow down in overall system performance -- particularly in the flower and jewelry applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5 and then installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0, NBA 3.0, and Golf Clubs 4.1. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do? Signed, Desperate * Dear Desperate, First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while Husband 1.0 is an Operating System. Please enter the command ""! http: I Thought You Loved Me.html"" and try to download Tears 6.2 and don't forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If that application works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. But remember,overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0 or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta. Whatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources). Also, do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance. We recommend! Food 3.0 and HotLingerie 7.7. Good Luck, Tech Support * Dear Tech Support: Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6. I can''t seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favorite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help! Thanks, Troubled User * Dear Troubled User: This is a very common problem that men complain about. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING !!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony/Child Support. I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application ""Yes Dear"" to alleviate software augmentation. The best course of action is to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE! because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway. Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5, and Do Bills 4.2. However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0! WARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system! Best of luck, Tech Support",human,6a6ntq,21,1494348839,0,4015,4015,668,5.0104790419161676,98

Ted was a young boy who used to spend all of his time playing sports and making music. He never went on the computer because his parents forbid him from touching any computer because they knew all the bad stuff you could find on the internet. Nevertheless, Ted was happy and went on without computers until he got to high school. All his friends were playing video games and having fun and he started to feel a bit left out, so when he got home one day from school, he begged his mother to get him a computer. “Please mother, please, all my friends are playing computer games!” He would cry, but his mother continued to deny him. 1 week later the issue rose again in his friends group at school and everyone was confused why Ted couldn’t play video games with him. After repetitive failure from his mother, he asked his dad. “Please father, please, all my friends are playing it!” But his father denied him as well. Ted was really angry and all he wanted to do was play online with his friends every once in a while. He thought he’d take matters into his own hands and he stole his fathers computer and hid it in his room. That night he played with his friends for hours and hours until morning, then he secretly stayed home and played all day. His dad didn’t notice until that afternoon, when he walked into his office and his computer was missing, so he asked his son Ted if he touched it. Ted owned up and gave the computer back, but had a tantrum afterwards. “WHY DON’T I GET TO PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS” he yelled in tears. Feeling pity, his dad finally bought him a laptop. Ted was on it 10 hours a day and refused when his parents told him to get off. After 2 months nothing had changed and his parents started to get worried about his wellbeing. They approached him to talk about it. Ted agreed, but only if he could play video games whilst they talked. “So Ted” his mother said, “we’ve been worrying about you lately” “uh-hu” Ted said. “Seriously son!” His father yelled, “this needs to stop!” “Mhm yep” Ted replied. “Are you listening to us Ted?” His mother said, but Ted didn’t even reply. “You know what son?” His father yelled, “you are a dick Ted!”",human,by65q3,7,1559985310,0,2176,2176,407,4.346437346437346,23

He gave Noah the blueprints, saying: ""You have 6 months to build the Ark before I will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights.""

"Frozen parrot

A young man named John received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird’s mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity.\n\nJohn tried and tried to change the bird’s attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to ‘clean up’ the bird’s vocabulary. Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even more rude. John, in desperation, threw up his hand, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer.\n\nFor a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute. Fearing that he’d hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John’s outstretched arms and said “I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I’m sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.”\n\nJohn was stunned at the change in the bird’s attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird spoke-up, very softly, “May I ask what the turkey did?”",ai,ai_6848,0,0,1,1351,1351,237,4.70042194092827,16

"Franz was reading his book on death row...

It was the ‘storm of the century’. On death row, Franz was reading his religious texts, looking for God, even as the inmates of the neighbouring cells were having an explosive argument about who should get to shower first. ’14 days to execution’, Franz thought, as he physically and mentally trembled. If there were ever a time for divine interference, it was now. That was when everything went dark. ‘This must be a power shortage,’ Franz mused to himself. ‘Wait, the backup generators obviously aren’t working either, or maybe just not yet. Maybe the electric doors are unlocked?’ Optimistically, Franz pushed on his cell door, which did give way! Adrenaline now coursing through his veins, Franz realised that this was it. He got to his feet and ran through multiple corridors, none of which had working doors. Then, he spotted a lone guard running up the corridor, obviously out of breath. With a quick punch and jab, the guard was down on the floor, and Franz snapped his neck with the adroitness of a practiced fighter and killer, which he was after all. The commotion in the rest of the prison, added to the noise of the rain, covered the noise generated by the quick melee. Searching through the guard’s possessions, Franz was delighted to find not only a wallet, but car keys! After quickly donning the guard’s gear, he ran towards the exit of the prison unstopped by anyone, and drove to his freedom. 300 miles away and in a small town of different state, Franz finally stopped to get what he needed after abandoning the car in the deep woods and taking along a bag-pack. ‘They’ll never find me now,’ he reasoned. It was then that he saw an extremely elegant lady with flaxen hair, walking down the street. Franz was tall, dark, handsome, and extremely charismatic. Knowing his strengths, he approached the lady, posing as a bag-packer. Over a short but sweet conversation, he convinced the lady, Elise, to let him stay the night at her place. Once the television came on in the morning though, bearing Franz’s mugshot and a ‘shoot on sight’ recommendation, it quickly dawned on Elise that she was harbouring an Eastern-European gangster who was also a wanted serial killer. ‘NO WAY!’ Elise shouted at Franz, as Franz begged her to give him a chance. Ordinarily this would have just meant one more dead body. But over the night, Franz realised that he really loved Elise. Besides, from a pragmatic point of view a dead body popping up in this town would be of no help to himself, especially when the police search was centred 300 miles away. Using every last drop of his linguistic virtuosity, Franz told Elise the very sad story of a child in a family of gangsters, who was born solely to be a mere pawn in the web of crime lynchpins. He managed to convince Elise to harbour him for just a few days. Those few days turned into weeks, then months, and eventually years. Using a stolen identity, Franz and Elise were able to build a new life together, and enjoy everything that normal couples would. They toured the alpine paradises of Switzerland, and the caverns of Sonora. They enjoyed Italian operas, and American soaps. They engaged in extreme sports, and watched spectator games. But the one thing they shared a particular partiality for was comedy, in all its forms. After 13 years of sheer unadulterated bliss though, Elise was hit by the sudden discovery that she had late stage cancer, and only a few months to live. The first few days after the revelation were marked with intense anguish and bitterness for the couple. But as they slowly accepted Elise’s cruel fate, the couple were able to push forward and live their lives to the fullest, despite the impending tragedy. Gradually though, Elise’s energy waned, and the couple went from spending their time out rappelling and rock climbing, to spending never-ending nights in the ICU. One night, as she was coughing up blood, Elise whispered laboriously to Franz, ‘I think this is it. I don’t think I’ll get past tonight. Can you get him to come?’ Franz fumbled for his mobile phone and made a quick phone call. Over the last few months, Franz had managed to get a famous comedian to promise to do a stand-up routine for just himself and Elise, and he was now redeeming the promise he had extracted. After all, humour was the one thing that he shared with Elise most profoundly, and both of them wanted to spend their last day together, enjoying what they loved most. A mere 5 minutes later, there was a knock on the hospital door. A surprised Franz opened the door, and found himself staring at an entire SWAT team and down the barrels of their guns. In that moment, he knew the game was up. Instantly he fully felt the delayed tiredness of all the last few months. ‘Is it him?’ Elise mumbled from her bed quite hoarsely and inaudibly. And as the last 14 beautiful years flashed in his head, Franz tiredly replied: &gt;!It's not the joke. It's the execution.!&lt;",human,d94z81,125,1569425778,0,4979,4979,875,4.690285714285714,50

"Big mistake

As a guitarist, I play many gigs. Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost. I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do so I started to play. The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man. As I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full. As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.”\n\nApparently, I’m still lost...",ai,ai_4706,0,0,1,1260,1260,246,4.121951219512195,18

"An out of work pianist with Tourette's Syndrome was strolling around the streets...

An out of work pianist with Tourette's Syndrome was strolling around the streets and bars of Soho one sunny afternoon. Walking down Dean Street he sees a lounge bar with a sign in the window: 'Pianist wanted for evening performances'. ""Fucking get in there you cunt!"" he says to himself and goes to the bar. ""Get the fucking manager of this pigshit middle class wank pit please you cock sucking cunt"", he says to a somewhat startled barman. The barman however obliges and his manager comes upstairs. ""Can I help you sir?' he says. ""Yes you can you fucking fat assed piece of shit, I saw your shitty advert in the cunting window and I'm here to fucking audition. Wanker!"" The manager is naturally a little put off by the man's abrasive manner but his dire need for a top class pianist forces him to agree to an audition. The first tune the pianist plays is an uplifting jazzy number, not too involving, yet utterly melodic. At the end the thrilled barman cries, ""Wonderful! Wonderful! What was that called?"" ""That song, you big nosed fucking twat, was called 'Excuse Me Prime Minister But I Just Spunked In Your Fucking Daughter's Eye, And Now The Cunt's Blind.' "" ""Oh"" says the manager, somewhat taken aback, ""err, can you play me another? Something a little less lively maybe?"" ""Fucking wanker..."" interjects the pianist before launching into a powerful ballad of such beauty that it leaves the manager in tears. The manager, through his teardrops asks him the title. ""That little number was called 'Sometimes When You Fuck A Bird Up The Shit Box You Get Crap On Your Bell End.' "" ""I see"" says the manager. ""Have you got any songs with less offensive titles?"" ""Well there's my jazz number 'Do You Want Me To Spit In Your Ringpiece', or there's the epic 'I Don't Give A Fuck If You're Older My Dear, You've Still Got Fucking Cracking Jugs' "". ""Look,"" says the manager, ""I think you're a superb pianist but the title of your songs are a little dodgy, to say the least. I will hire you on the condition that you do not introduce your songs or speak to the audience."" ""Fuck it"", says the pianist, ""why cunting not?"" On his first night everything is going superbly and the crowd are lapping up his repertoire and his silence is simply being received as modesty. The only thing putting off the pianist is that in the front row there is a gorgeous blonde in a black evening dress with a split up the side revealing the tops of her stockings, and a plunging neckline which boasts a proud and inviting cleavage. During the interval the pianist has got such a stonking hard-on that he decides to go to the bog and knock one out. Just as he has shot his load he hears himself being re-introduced over the sound system, so he rushes back to the stage to finish his act. After the show he is at the bar relaxing when the same blonde approaches him. ""Hi"" she says. ""Oh, hello"" he winces, struggling to hold in the expletives. She leans over and whispers in his ear, ""Do you know your cock is hanging out of your trousers and spunk is dribbling onto your shoes?"" Placing his beer confidently on the bar, the pianist grins, looks her square in the eye and says, ""Know it? I fucking wrote it!!""",human,5qjvqr,59,1485553020,0,3263,3263,591,4.521150592216582,27

Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm instantly realised, that is was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one the rumoured Magical notes that musicians had theorised must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. And on Sam’s 20th Birthday, it happened again. This time, the town was so impacted that no one moved, spoke or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they new that Sam had found the second note... And the next year on Sam’s Birthday, the town had realised there was a pattern involved. This time all the towns people were present in the monastery’s nave, watching in awe as Sam hit the glorious third note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam’s notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical note that he knew must be there. Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closed monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame.

"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam...

His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n\nSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n\nAnd on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...\n\nAnd the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n\nAnd on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n\nSuddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.\n\nThe townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.\n\nThe mayor approached the lead monk of the order. \""What happened?\"" he asked, exasperated.\n\nThe old monk shook his head sadly. \""Isn't it obvious?\"" he said. \""Sam sung Note 7.\""",ai,ai_2603,0,0,1,2506,2506,430,4.8279069767441865,34

Then, he went back to the abbey. ""Here's a complete video of me reciting the bible."" ""Great job."" The monk said. ""Now, you have to build ten monasteries in ten different countries. Don't worry, our generous abbey will pay for you."" ""Uhm... Okay, deal"" Two months have passed and ten monasteries were indeed built in ten different countries. The next day, the journalist went back to the abbey. ""Am I a monk now?"" ""Not yet. You have to help 1,000 families in Africa by finding them a home and a steady income."" ""DAM- I mean, yeah, piece of cake."" It took the journalist three months to help all the families. Exhausted, he rushed back to the abbey. ""Tell me, am I finally a monk?!""

"Late to a funeral

As a singer I sing at many funerals & I was recently asked by a funeral director to play & sing at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery out in the country. As I was not familiar with the area, I got lost. I finally arrived an hour late and saw that the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play. The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I sang like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.\n\nAs I sang & played “Amazing Grace”, the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished, I packed up my keyboard and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.\n\nAs I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I’ve never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.” Apparently, I’m still lost….",ai,ai_1527,0,0,1,1291,1291,254,4.082677165354331,17
"An elephant gets a splinter in his foot, and the pain is killing him.

He asks the other elephants to help him get it out, but their trunks and feet are too big and clumsy to do anything with it. He sees a couple of monkeys, the only denizens of the jungle possessed of opposable thumbs, but the monkeys are assholes. They just point at him and laugh. Finally he spies a mouse scurrying by, and though he hates mice, in desperation he stops the mouse and asks for help. The mouse looks up and says, ""why would I help my enemy? We've never gotten along. You're scared of me, and I'm scared of you."" The elephant begs, ""please, Mr. Mouse! This thing is killing me, I'll do anything you want."" The mouse says, ""okay, Mr. Elephant. I'll take out the splinter, but you gotta let me fuck you."" The elephant thinks to himself, ""well, it might look a little embarrassing, but I won't even feel a mouse-cock, while this splinter is killing me."" So he says, ""okay, Mr. Mouse, you got a deal."" So the mouse pulls the splinter and the elephant breathes a giant sigh of relief. The mouse rubs his paws together with glee and says, ""Okay, time to give up that ass!"" So the elephant, not one to either forget or welch on a debt, sighs and gets down on all fours so the mouse can climb up on him.

One of them catches his breath and says ""watch this!"" as he grabs a coconut, takes careful aim and throws it right at the elephant's head. The elephant trumpets loudly in pain as the coconut leaves a big lump on his forehead.

"There once was a guy who had been having chronic trouble in trying to get an erection...

After weeks of frustration, he finally breaks down and and goes to the doctor. The doctor gives him a thorough examination and finally makes the diagnosis. ""Well, there's good news and there's bad news,"" she says. ""The bad news is that the muscles around your penis are deteriorating, and there is no cure."" The guy, on the verge of panic, finally regains his composure. ""So what's the good news?"" he asks. The doctor says: ""There is an experimental treatment available, but there are no guarantees. It involves transplanting the muscles from a baby elephant's trunk into your penis. Would you like to try it?"" The guy thinks about it and finally says, ""Well, the thought of going through life without being able to have sex is just too much for me. What have I got to lose? Let's do it."" So the doctor performs the operation. A few weeks later, the guy takes his girlfriend out to a nice restaurant to celebrate his new equipment.

"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.

His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n\nSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n\nAnd on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...\n\nAnd the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n\nAnd on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n\nSuddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.\n\nThe townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.\n\nThe mayor approached the lead monk of the order. \""What happened?\"" he asked, exasperated.\n\nThe old monk shook his head sadly. \""Isn't it obvious?\"" he said. \""Sam sung Note 7.\""",ai,ai_2664,0,0,1,2504,2504,430,4.823255813953488,34

It hopped its track and careened off of a pier into the Hudson River. All of his passengers were killed but Harry managed to swim back to shore. He was terrified of what would happen so he fled the scene (and, eventually, the city) before police and rescue crews could arrive. He settled in Houston under an assumed name and took a job in a grocery store, trying to keep as low a profile as possible. He lived a quiet life, and every day he would watch the Houston cable-cars going up and down the street and he longed for what he had lost. One day, he decided that he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school again, this time in Houston and under his new name. He did a little better this time, having been through the classwork before, and graduated with a B average and was assigned to a nice route in La Porte. His passengers loved him and he loved his job. But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable car. It hopped its track and ended up in Trinity Bay. All of his passengers were killed, but Harry managed to swim back to shore. Fearing that authorities would put this accident together with the one in New York, he again fled the scene. This time he ended up in San Francisco with yet another assumed name. He figured that, if he couldn't operate his beloved cable cars (for fear of getting caught), he could at least see them everywhere he went, as San Francisco is the cable-car capital of the world. This satisfied him for a little while, but eventually he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school yet again. He excelled in his classwork this time around (having been through the program twice before) and graduated magna cum laude. He was assigned the highly-coveted Market Street route and drove it for quite a while without incident. But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable-car. It hopped its tracks and ended up in the San Francisco Bay. All of his passengers were killed and as Harry swam back to shore, the police were waiting for him. In the subsequent investigation and trial, prosecutors put all the pieces together. They figured that he was the same guy who killed all those people in Houston and New York. It was the trial of the century and at the end of it, Harry was sentenced to die in the electric chair for his crimes (the actions having been deemed so egregiously willful and persistent as to constitute premeditation). He was transferred to Alcatraz to await his execution. He was a model prisoner, never causing any trouble, and every day he woke and did exactly 52 jumping jacks and 52 sit-ups and 52 push-ups in his cell to keep himself occupied. The day before his scheduled execution, the warden came to him and asked what he would like for his last meal. Harry thought about it for a minute and said “I would like a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk”. The warden stared blankly at him. “Harry,” he said, “we have access to the best chefs in the world. This is your last meal, and you can have anything you want. Steak, lobster, name it!” Harry shook his head and repeated his request for a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk. His disgusting meal was brought to him and he wolfed it down hungrily. The next day, his head was shaved and last rites were administered, and Harry was led to the electric chair and hooked up. At the appointed time, prison guards threw the switch and counted to ten before turning off the current to the chair. But Harry was fine. Smoldering a bit at the spots where the contacts met his skin, perhaps, but otherwise the picture of health. Flummoxed, the guards took Harry back to his cell and began the long process of checking and rechecking their equipment for malfunctions, but they couldn’t find anything. A new execution date was set for one month later, and Harry went back to his morning exercise routine of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups to keep his mind and body occupied while he waited. The eve of his second execution arrived and the warden visited Harry again to take the order for his last meal. “A rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk,” Harry said. The warden just shook his head and asked him Harry was sure, then arranged to have his meal brought to him. The next day, guards shaved his head again, Harry was administered his last rites again, and he was marched to the electric chair and hooked up again. This time, though, they weren’t taking any chances. At the appropriate time, they threw the switch and left the juice flowing for a full minute. And when they were finished, Harry was just fine. The warden was nervous. A little known California law stipulated that the state could only make three attempts to execute a prisoner, and if that failed they had to let him go. Harry was returned to his cell where he resumed his daily morning exercise regimen of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups. Another month passed, and on the eve of his third execution, Harry was visited by the warden, who just said “let me guess” as he wheeled in a cart with a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk. Harry thanked him politely and ate his dinner. The next morning, they shaved his head (AGAIN!) and delivered last rites (AGAIN!) and marched him to the execution chamber, where he was hooked up (AGAIN!) to the electric chair. This time, prison officials weren’t taking any chances. The entire Bay Area power grid was diverted to Alcatraz. They threw the switch (cutting electricity to millions of customers) and left the juice running for a full half hour. The execution chamber buzzed with the awesome power being fed into the chair. You could taste the ions in the air. And when they turned off the power…. Harry was just fine. The warden shook his head in disbelief. “Well, Harry,” he said, “we have to let you go. California law stipulates that we can only make three attempts at an execution. But before I do, I really have to know. How did you survive three executions? Was it the jumping jacks, the sit-ups, and the push-ups? Was it the rotten banana, rotten apple, and spoiled milk? What IS your secret?” Harry just shook his head and shrugged, “I guess I’m just not a very good conductor.”",human,bb5r1h,5,1554801363,0,6749,6749,1224,4.513888888888889,69

Unfortunately, after just a few years, they are in financial trouble. In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a bull from the stockyard in a far town so that they can breed their own stock. They only have $600 left. Upon leaving, the brunette tells her sister, 'When I get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home.' The brunette arrives at the stockyard, inspects the bull, and decides she wants to buy it. The man tells her that he will sell it for $599, no less. After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news. She walks into the telegraph office and says, 'I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pickup truck and drive out here so we can haul it home.' The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, 'It's just 99 cents a word.' Well, after paying for the bull, the brunette only has $1 left. She realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one word. After a few minutes of thinking, she nods and says, 'I want you to send her the word 'comfortable.' The operator shakes his head. 'How is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her just the word 'comfortable?' The brunette explains, 'My sister's blonde. The word's big. She'll read it very slowly ... com-for-da-bull.'",human,cjr269,145,1564489713,0,1620,1620,308,4.259740259740259,19

"So a guy walks into a bar...

So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can’t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there’s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”\n\nSo the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”\nAnd the guy’s, like, “World peace.”\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”\nAnd the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”\n\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”\nAnd all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”\n\nAnd the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. \nAnd he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.\n\nSo the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”\nAnd the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Well done.”\n\nAnd then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\nAnd the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”\n\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.”",ai,ai_1277,0,0,1,6095,6095,1045,4.832535885167464,99

"A musician performs at a nightclub everyday.

The musician, Joe is known by the regulars to be of the most unoriginal artists. Every day, he sings the same song that his sister wrote in eight grade. The regulars actively despise him for singing the song every day, but sometimes newcomers enjoy it. On one particular day, an executive of a record label comes to the nightclub looking for new talents to sign with him. When he comes across Joe, he is stunned by the talent he saw in him. The regulars laughed as they saw the idiot executive sign with Joe. However, Joe is soon a rising star in the music industry. Although he only performed a single song, it was almost on the Top 100 songs of that week. People began to request that he write more songs and he agreed. The problem was that Joe had no idea how to write a song. His manager refused to let him get a songwriter as the song had to come from his heart, like the manager thought the first song did. Joe kept trying to write a good song, but his mind was blank. Meanwhile, the song suddenly became the top song of the year. Everybody was singing it, but lots of people thought that he was only going to be a one-hit wonder. It all worsened when Joe's sister first heard her brother singing the song. Joe's sister immediately published proof that she was the one who came up with the song idea and that her brother stole it. Some of the crowd turned on Joe, but the majority of his fans stuck with Joe and defended him, saying that they never would have heard the song if Joe hadn't copied it. However, this experience was the inspiration that Joe needed to write his own song. He promised his fans that it would be an original song. He worked for days trying to perfect it, and once he was satisfied, he was ready to perform. He refused to let anybody hear the song before he went out on stage. Once he got on the stage he said ""Hey guys, this is a new song that I wrote myself. I wanted to share it with all of you because it reflects what's really in my heart. This song speaks about how I was like and what I did before I became a hit artist after stealing my sister's song. It also speaks to all of you haters out there, who call me a no good thief. Queue the music!"" The lights dimmed and the audience became quiet. Then, the music started but it was unexpected. It was one that they were very well familiar with, when Joe started to sing. ""This-post-shit-oh Care bout' reposts are to kill-o this petite Joe They yell ""K"" to nag and cause a Ailed, oh weak Joe Parents tell their a-children say 'Not a star, con me Joe?' Once he was done with his song, the whole crowd started cheering. ""Great performance!"" his manager said, completely ignoring the fact that he ripped off Despacito. ""We don't even need to call this a parody, it's a completely new song!"" Many years past, and Joe became famous in the music industry for plagiarism. However, his fans still continued to defend him saying that ""He did the original writers a favor by spreading their music."" Some songwriters complained that when they first wrote the song, they only got 100,000 hits but Joe was getting billions. One day, Joe got sick of the hate. He said ""Fuck this,"" and decided to actually write an original song. It took him years and years to devise this masterpiece and he finally completed it. When he handed it in to his manager, the manager shook his head. ""This song's a piece of shit"" the manager said. ""But... I spent years working on it"" exclaimed Joe. ""It took 1000x more effort than my other songs"". The manager looked and him and replied ""Go ahead, put it to the test. Let me know when they laugh you off the stage."" Once Joe sang the song at his next concert, his ratings plummeted. Everyone disliked his new music and called it boring, long, and meaningless. He left the stage disgraced, and was met by his gloating manager. The manager started speaking ""You know, they have this saying where I come from. People would rather hear something good a million times than an original piece that was a disaster only once."" ""Was my song really that bad?"" Joe asked, disgraced. ""Yeah, but that's not what I'm talking about"" said the manager. ""This fucking post is a mess of shit that I can't even begin to describe. I have no idea how any of you actually read through that whole thing. There's no punchline except for this and the writer was obviously drunk at noon while writing this.

"Dear Tech Support

* Dear Tech Support, Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a distinct slow down in overall system performance -- particularly in the flower and jewelry applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5 and then installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0, NBA 3.0, and Golf Clubs 4.1. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do? Signed, Desperate\n\n* Dear Desperate, First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while Husband 1.0 is an Operating System. Please enter the command \""! http: I Thought You Loved Me.html\"" and try to download Tears 6.2 and don't forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If that application works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. But remember,overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0 or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta. Whatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources). Also, do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance. We recommend! Food 3.0 and HotLingerie 7.7. Good Luck, Tech Support \n\n* Dear Tech Support: Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6. I can''t seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favorite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help! Thanks, Troubled User\n\n* Dear Troubled User: This is a very common problem that men complain about. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING !!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony/Child Support. I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application \""Yes Dear\"" to alleviate software augmentation. The best course of action is to enter the command C:\\APOLOGIZE! because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway. Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5, and Do Bills 4.2. However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0! WARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system! Best of luck, Tech Support",ai,ai_5883,0,0,1,4030,4030,666,5.051051051051051,98

"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.

His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated. The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""",human,bb5pou,26,1554801043,0,2474,2474,438,4.648401826484018,34

"[Long] A guy wanted to lose weight

There's a guy. We'll call him Bob. Bob is a fat slob, but one day decides that he's going to turn things around and start getting in shape. So he sees an ad for a new workout program, and calls the number. The operator agrees to start him off with a one-month trial of their lowest level program, and tells Bob to be ready to go running first thing in the morning, and someone will be out to his house. So first thing in the morning, hes all dressed and ready, and hears a knock on the door. He opens the door and sees the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. Just eye-poppingly gorgeous. She's wearing a T-shirt that reads ""If you catch me, you can have me"". And without a word, she takes off running. Well Bob takes off after her. He chases her several blocks before he's just to tired to continue and collapses on the pavement. After a bit to catch his breath, he gets up and realizes she's long gone, and he doesn't even know which way she went, so he just has to go home. The next day, there's another knock on his door. Same girl, same T-shirt, same drill as before. He still doesn't catch her, but he gets a few blocks farther before he's forced to stop. This process is repeated for the whole month, and while Bob never manages to catch up to her, he does lose a lot of weight trying. After the last session, he gets a phone call from the program, asking how his trial month went, and if he'd like to try the next-level program. It's a more strenuous program, not for the faint of heart, but if Bob wants to give it a go, they'll let him try it. Bob, decides to give it a shot. Next morning, there's a knock on the door. It's a new girl with the same T-shirt, so beautiful that she makes the previous one look like a snaggle-toothed hag by comparison. The sort of woman Bob didn't even think could really exists. She flashes him a quick smile that makes his heart melt and takes off running even faster than the first girl. Bob chases after her even harder and more determined than before, and manages to keep up with her for several miles before falling out. Like before, this continues on for the whole month, Bob getting more in shape and managing to run further and faster each time. The last day of the month comes by, and Bob is ready and waiting. By this time, he's a lean, mean running machine. He gets up before dawn to warm up and stretch, eat a good breakfast, and make sure he's well hydrated. So when that knock on the door comes, it's off to the races. The girl takes off at a dead sprint, but Bob follows right on her heels. She runs up and down every street in town, mile after mile, juking and weaving and doing everything she can to lose Bob, but Bob is in shape now and keeps right on her heels. All day he chases her around town, and then, after running a virtual marathon around town, he finally catches her, and he has her. So Bob is feeling pretty good about himself now. He's gone from a fat slob that no woman would give the time of day to to a stud that's banging supermodels. But he wonders if this is really as far as he can go. So he calls up the number and asks if there's any other programs. The salesman hesitates before answering, then tells him that yes, they do have one more level of program, but it's only for the *most* dedicated clients and he doesn't really think it's suitable for Bob. But Bob is pretty self-confident now, so he insists. After a while, he eventually gets the salesman to relent sign him up for the top level program. Morning comes, and Bob hears a knock on the door. Given that he'd thought the first girl was practically a perfect 10, and the second one was even better, he's anxious to see what the best one looks like. He opens the door, and sees a gigantic brute of a man, at least seven feet tall and sporting what looks like 300 pounds of pure muscle. The brute has a cruel smirk on his face that makes Bob's blood freeze in is veins, and is staring directly at Bob the way a lion stares at a wounded zebra. Bob looks at the man's T-shirt, which reads ""If I catch you, I get to keep you"".",human,6appq1,3,1494570878,0,4097,4097,790,4.186075949367089,45

Once back in the days of knights and dragons there was a mountain to which people would travel from leagues around. At the summit of this mountain was a magic cradle which would heal the illness of any child placed in it, but only if the child's parent would then roll up into a ball and tumble down the mountain. If the parent walked down at all, the child would not be healed. A poor woman who's baby was desperately ill traveled for many miles and came to the base of the mountain. There she met a small boy with some drums who told her to take courage, that his name was Benny and that the trek would be hard but the end would be worth it. So she hiked up the mountain. A quarter of the way up she met a woman playing a piano who told her. ""My my name is Ethel. Stay strong, you baby will be made well. So she continued on. Half way up the mountain she met a little girl who played a violin and said. My name is Emily. Drink from this stream if you're thirsty. It's not far now. Stay strong. So the woman continued on and on. A fog rolled in. She despaired and thought about giving up. Little did she know she was only 5 minutes from the magic cradle.

BILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken. AL GORE: I invented the chicken. JOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it. AL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white? DR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he is acting by not taking on his current problems before adding any new problems.

"Aboriginal Rituals

A couple years back, I stumbled on a surprising reference to the astonishing longevity of Aboriginal shamans living in the Australian outback. Reliable birth records aren't available before the early 20th century, but government officials have noted an astounding number of nonagenarians and centenarians. And anthropologists report--but, of course, discount--stories of village elders living for 150 years, 200 years, or more. There are weirder stories, incredible enough to be consigned to footnotes in academic texts: that the shaman of Jimbilum arrived in that community in 1872, already impossibly old, and was dispensing advice, justice, and herbal remedies well until the late 1990s. His cause of death is assumed to be exposure: he left the village one night and was never seen again. Implausibly, residents of Ngunulum claim that their shaman--who, again, departed without a word, some time in early 1960s--claimed to have been personally acquainted with William Dampier, a man who last set foot in Australia in 1688. I try to be careful with extreme claims, so I'm not going to say that every Aboriginal shaman is immortal. I will, though, go so far as to say that there's not a single verifiable case of one of them dying. It gets stranger. Like many traditional faith healers, shamans follow a number of special rules and taboos. You have the usual prayers, incantations, and prohibitions, and one especially odd dietary fixation: shamans insist on drinking a broth made by boiling water and adding chunks of koala meat. This is not a minor rule. The departure of the shaman of Jimbilum, for example, coincided with the Australian Department of Environment's launching of a poaching investigation. Ngunulum's spiritual leader left after a long drought led to the death of the region's last remaining koalas. There is no record of an Aboriginal shaman dying; there is no record of an Aboriiginal shaman going a day without drinking water that's been steeped in koala flesh and boiled. I had to investigate. You're familiar with the Dark Web, right? (Don't kid me--of course you are.) I opened an account on one of the lesser-known sites, one that ignored narcotics and credit cards, in favor of more exotic goods. For .275 bitcoin (shipping included), I had a sample of freshly-harvested koala meat en route. After two weeks, I was pretty sure I'd been had. And pretty sure I deserved it, too. How much time and money should a grown adult spend investigating third-hand reports--and violating endangered species laws on several continents, to boot? But then, on Monday, a package arrived. Lumpy, misshappen, sealed with three different kinds of tape, it felt strangely heavy and cool to the touch. I opened it. The roiling steam looked a lot less dramatic when I realized that, obviously, when you ship meat intercontinentally, you pack it with dry ice. The koala looks smaller on your kitchen counter than it looks in pictures. I've seen lots of pictures of koalas, and always thought they looked cute, but never tasty. The impression doesn't improve in person. But it was too late to turn back. I'd already set some water to boil. I stashed most of the koala in the freezer, and sliced off a toe. In 1927, anthropologist Ursula McConnel recorded a list of rituals of the Wik Mungkan. Among them, the ceremonial boiling of a water infused with koala bits. Exactly 1.2 liters, exactly 3 hours. I followed her recipe to the letter. And it was DISGUSTING. The foulest, nastiest thing I'd ever tasted. It coats your tongue and lacerates your nostrils and the taste stays with you for hours and the memory is with me still. If this was the route to immortality, maybe dying was a better option. But I wasn't finished with my research. I pored over my books and papers, looking for more information on the ritual, and found that it was, in fact, permissible to fiddle with the recipe. Shamans in different regions had different spins on the concoction: as long as you boiled the water long enough, and used genuine koala, the other ingredients didn't matter. After some experimentation, I've found exactly the right mix of flavorings to make it about as tasty as any other beverage. I guess you could say this really improved my koala tea of life.",human,6s822f,72,1502135196,0,4273,4273,716,4.967877094972067,46

"Farting in bed

This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years, the only friction in their marriage was the husbands habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke the noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, Honey you were right all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you. What do you mean? asked his wife. Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers.

"An average father gives his average son.....

....a ping pong table for his 12th birthday, and to his surprise the son loves ping pong. Plays it every day and night, and when no friends or family wants to play a round with him the kid sets up the table against a wall and pracices with himself. After a few years the father notices that his son is playing ping pong less and less, He asks him about this and the son replies, ""Can't. No more ping pong balls"". The father looks and just like his son had told him there were no longer any balls left on the table. ""OK"", he thought, he lost them. No big deal. Approaching the sons 14th birthday the father decides he wants to do something extra special. He finds his son watching TV and says, ""Son! It's almost your 14th birthday! What kind of bike would you like?!"". The son (without moving his head away from the TV) just replies, ""NO Bike dad, I want ping pong balls"". The father was a little taken back by this, he continued and asked, ""What do you mean? You don't want a bike son? You're turning 14?!?!"". The son made further comment and just returned to his program. Well this wasn't going to fly the father thought. You know what.. I'm buying him the damn bike! So the father goes to the local sporting goods store and picks his son out a nice stylish bike with all of the shocks and removable doo dads he can get. He also decides to get him a few packs of ping pong balls and throw them in the helmet hanging from the handlebars. The morning of his sons birthday the father sets up the bike with a big ribbon then goes off to work. Returning home the father finds the bike sitting in the living room seemingly untouched. The bow is still on it, the kick stand still in the perfect little carpet divit it created from this morning. .. but .. all of the ping pong balls were gone. The father assumes the son must be playing ping pong! But to his surprise he finds him in his bedroom playing on his game console. The father asks the son, ""Son! What is wrong with the bike? don't you like it?"" ""Yea dad, good bike, great bike, love the bike"", replies the son. the father can't help but question; ""so what happened to the ping pong balls"". but the son ignores him. The father assumes his son lost the balls already and is too embarrased to tell him so drops the subject and moves on. the next year for the boys 15th birthday the father decides he wants him to have a new computer. Knowing this isn't something you can just buy for someone he asks his son, ""Son! What kind of computer would you like for your birthday?"". The son answers shortly, ""No computer, Ping pong balls"". The father thinks this is a bit odd but knows how much his son enjoys ping pong so doesn't say anything else about the subject. After buying the new computer for his son and setting it up the father (again) tosses a few packages of ping pong balls in with the present and off to work he goes. 5pm rolls around and the father returns home to find the computer hasn't even been started up. His son is sitting in the living room listening to music and the ping pong balls have all dissapeared. This time the father wants answers; he says to the son ""Son! What was wrong with the computer?"" ""Nothing dad, good computer, great computer, love the computer"", replies the son. OK thinks the father, ""Also what happened to the ping pong balls?"". The son doesn't reply, going back to his music he ignores the father. Being a good trustworthy son in the past the father decides to let this drop. If his son didn't like the presents he's sure he would tell him. Approaching the sons 16th birthday the father thinks, ""Ok this is the year! I will finally give him a present he won't be able to ignore! I'll buy him a car!"". The father finds the son and says ""Son! What kind of car do you want for your birthday?"" The son replies to the father with the same reply he's been giving for all occasions from 12 until now, ""Dad, I want ping pong balls"". ""What?!"" exclaims the father, ""You are turning 16! you are getting a car!"". Being a little annoyed now the father decides to pull a fast one on his son, After buying him a new car he decided to prank his son and fill it from floor to sunroof with thousands of ping pong balls. He put them in the trunk, the vents, the glove box, under the seats.. everywhere.. Pushed the car into the drive way with a big bow on it and off to work he went. Driving upto the house after work the father notices the car doors are open, so is the trunk. As he gets closed he also notices the bow and ribbons were still on the car... It hadn't been moved! AND ALL OF THE PING PONG BALLS ARE GONE! ""Ok"" he says to himself. ""He's good"" Thinking his son just taught him a lesson on pranking the father walks into the house expecting a pie in the face or to be drowned in his own ping pong ball joke... instead his son is just sitting at the computer chatting on MSN. ""Son! Don't you like the car!?"" yells the father. ""Yea dad, good car, great car, love the car"", replies the son. ""Well WTF happened to the ping pong balls?!"" the father almost screams. But again, the son just ignores his father. The father dismisses this as his son just trying to get under his skin for the innital prank and once again ignores it. So a few years have passed and for every occasion the son is asked what he would like his reply is only ever ""ping pong balls"". Unfortunatly for the son, around his mid 30's he's diagnosed with a terminal illness and is laying on his death bed. ""Son"", walks in the father, ""You are not long of this world. Is there anything I can do for you or get you to make you more comfortable? Pictures of loved ones? Sweets? Anything?"". The son looking very weak and pale says, ""ping pong balls dad... ping pong balls."" The father doesn't even argue this time; he runs down to the gift shop and gets a basket and fills it with sweets, flowers, goes into his wallet and pulls out all of the family photos and by sure dumb luck there is a 5 pack of ping pong balls in the gift shop so he buys that as well. Returning to the room the father gives the basket to his son and kisses him on the forehead. He turns around and asks the nurse a question, only to find when he turned back that ALL OF THE PING PONG BALLS WERE GONE! This does it: ""Son?"" asks the father. ""Yes dad"" ""Have I been a good father to you?"" the father questions. ""Yes dad, you've been a good dad, great dad. I love you dad."" ""Then can I ask you one thing before our time is up?"". ""Yes dad, anything."" says the son. Looking very weak now. ""Ok, well, I just wanted to know after all of these years. What happened to all of the ping pong balls?"" said the father. ""Ok dad... I'll tell you."" and the son took a deep breath. Then he died.",human,btrv2u,4,1558993795,0,6737,6737,1294,4.206336939721793,80

In the days of the wild west, there was a young cowboy who wanted more than anything to be the fastest gunfighter in the world. He practiced every minute of his spare time, but he knew that he wasn't yet first-rate and that there must be something he was doing wrong. Sitting in a saloon one Saturday night, he recognized an elderly man seated at the bar who had the reputation of being a fast gun in his day. The young gunslinger took a seat next to the old-timer, bought him a drink, and told him the story of his great ambition. ""Do you think you could give me some tips?"" he asked. The old man looked him up and down and said, ""Well, how fast are you?"" The young man drew his pistol pretty quick and before anyone knew it, then shoots the hat off of the piano player's head!"" The old man looks over at the piano player and says to the young man, ""Well, that wasn't bad. But you're wearing your gun too high. You should have your holster lower on your leg so you can get to your gun quicker when you draw. And son, tie the holster down on your leg."" The young man did as he was told, stood up, whipped out his Colt Peacemaker and shot the tie off the piano player. ""That's terrific!"" said the young gunslinger. ""Got any more tips for me?"" ""Yup,"" said the old man. ""Cut a notch out of your holster where the hammer hits it. That'll give you a smoother draw."" ""Will that make me faster?"" asked the younger man. ""You bet it will,"" said the old-timer. The young man took out his knife, cut the notch, stood up, drew his gun in a blur, then shot a cuff link off the piano player. ""Wow!"" said the young gunslinger. ""I'm learning' somethin' here. Got any more tips?"" The old man pointed to a large can in a corner of the saloon. ""See that axle grease over there? Coat your gun with it. Just but the gun in it, layer it with grease! "" The young man went over to the can and smeared some of the grease on the barrel of his gun. ""No,"" said the old-time, ""I mean smear it all over the gun, handle and all."" ""Will that make me a faster gunfighter?"" asked the young man.

I am a musician and recently got booked to play a music festival, one of the hilghts of my career. I played to one of the biggest crowds I have ever played to and at the end of the night I took a beautiful woman home. She proceeded to brake into her own home because the key wasnt working,then she opened the front door proclaiming \""it wasnt locked\"". I became the guard rails for her stumbling terror as she nearly fell into everything on the way to her bedroom. A few minutes later she said she needed to use the toilet so I waited about 10 minutes that's when I felt the need to check on her. I found her asleep on the john I picked her up and herded her into her room.Five minutes later she went back to the bathroom I waited 10 or so minutes, and sure enough she was asleep in the bathroom this time sprawled out on the floor. I picked her up and herded her to her room. Yet once again she decided to use the bathroom ,but this time she came back. She finally got under the blanket and went to sleep,the next morning her first words were \""oh my God did we have sex\"" I said \""no\"", then her mother brought over her 3 year old who woke me up, but not her by opening the door and staring at us. A few minutes later I met her brother who asked me if she was awake and about 10 minutes later she got up. She wanted to get ice so I went to her parents house next door, her dad asked me if I had a beer and thought my name was Philip even though I said George. I got the whole BF treatment without even getting a kiss. The next few days I stayed over at her house the farthest I got was spooning or \""cuddling\"" as she called it. The day after \""cuddling\"" she accused me of just hanging out to bang her I told her \""If I would have been feeling more presidential i would have grabbed your pussy when you were drunk\"".the next day she acted like she wanted to hang,but I never heard from her again. So my trip to play a festival was nearing its end it had it's up and downs but wasn't ready to stop going south.i later found out one band collected tips for every band made about $200 and kept all the money the venue gave for the bands.

He gave Noah the blueprints, saying: ""You have 6 months to build the Ark before I will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights.""

There's a ban on cutting local trees in order to save the Greater Spotted Barn Owl."" ""I tried to convince the environmentalists that I needed the wood to save the owls - but no go!""

"An Old Woman Moves in with her Son

Earning the consequences of age, an old woman moves in with her son's family to avoid the costs of a senior home. Not wealthy in life but investing in what she loved, the woman was forced to liquidate her assets to pay for expenses; her house had been foreclosed, piano written off, fine porcelain sold, and 1965 cobra--joy of her life--repossessed. After some years had gone by, her son had made it successfully, running the startup he joined that had made it big. His first desire to spend his money of course, was to find his mother's belongings. Setting out, he first went to the church that the grand piano had gone to. After long negotiations, for the church he been rather fond of its piano, the son agreed to take the old piano in return for donating a new one as well as a large tithe to the church. Second was the china. Bought by a connosieur, the collection was, fortuitously, being put up for auction at the present time. Spending thousands of dollars to get every piece, the son had managed to get the entirety of his mother's porcelain back. Finally was her love, her racer. However, it was proving impossible to find. Coming home after a whole day of searching, he finally decided to break the surprise to his mother. ""Mom, I've gotten back your grand piano, and all of your porcelain.

One day he was called upon by Kim Jong Un to compose a piece of music and have the Great North Korean Orchestra play it live to him in the Humble Auditorium.\n\nThe musician, not wanting to displease the Great Leader, did as he asked and got to work composing a piece of music.

...so they decided to start a flower shop in the name of the Lord. Now, these guys were the men of God, so all the people in the village wanted to buy from them, rather than the existing flower shop, which was not affiliated with the church. The owner of the existing flower shop felt this was entirely unfair, as he was there first, and they were stealing all of his customers to a market that he had the corner on. So he went over to the friars' shop and kindly asked them to take their business elsewhere or find some other way of making money. The friars laughed in his face, proclaiming how the greatness of the Lord had brought them into wealth. So he went home despondent and unsure of what to do. Then, he had the idea that maybe his wife could talk some sense into them. They ignored her requests as well. At this rate, he would be run out of business by the end of the month, so he went over and begged the friars to stop, saying he would even pay regular donations to church if they did so. Again, the friars remained steadfast, and ignored his wishes once more. As the final straw, the flower shop owner hired the toughest man in town, Hugh McTaggart, to go rough them up a little bit. Hugh did so, saying that if they didn't shut down he would destroy everything they owned. Fearless, and faithful that the righteousness of God would protect them from these heathens, the friars ignored Hugh as well. So the next day, Hugh came back to the friars' shop, took a giant hammer, and started smashing everything in the shop. The friars found they didn't have the funds to replace everything that was destroyed, so they finally decided to give in and close up their flower shop, proving that (are you ready?)

"The New York Philharmonic was conducting a rendition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony

If you are not familiar with Beethoven's 9th Symphony it's a tremendous piece of work, but the bass line is atrocious. Not because it is complicated, but because it goes like this:\n\n**\""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\""**\n\n\n\nAnd then approximately an hour an a half later it goes like this:\n\n\n\n**\""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\""**\n\n\nAnd then there's a round of applause and everyone take their bows and and exits stage right. The conductor had a great idea though, and the basses practiced this in the weeks leading up to the concert. The would play their first note \n\n**\""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\""**\n\n\nAnd then they would quietly lay down their basses on provided carpets, and exit the stage - waiting patiently to return an hour and a half later to play their final note:\n\n\n**\""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\""**\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the concert arrives, everyone is dressed to the nines (as is appropriate of course). The basses are shined and everyone is relaxed and ready. The conducter taps on his conducter's stand to get attention, raises his hands and with a gallant downstroke the basses play the ever living shit out of their note\n\n\n**\""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\""**\n\n\n\nAnd then quietly lay down their instruments on the provided carpets and step behind the curtain. This is where things go awry,\n\n\""Hey guys,\"" says the lead bass \""I have a great idea. There's a bar across the street and we have at least an hour and a half before we play our next note. Let's slip across and have a couple pints!\""\n\n\nEveryone thinks this is a fantastic idea, so the entire section hops along to the bar and downs a couple pints. One of the second basses after a while gets a little conserned and asks the lead bass if it was time to go back. \""No, we got time. See, I tied a string to the last page of the conductors score attached to a transciever. When he gets to that section I'll get a buzz on my phone and we can head back.\""\n\n\nEveryone thinks that this is brilliant so they knock back a few more pints before suddenly the lead bass stands up and announces it's time to go. They bounce back across the street, through the musicians entrance, and up to the curtain to peek through and sure enough, they're right on time. So they slip through, pick up their instruments and look up at the conductor and...he is angry.\n\nSuper angry. \n\n\nReady to bust a blood vessel angry.\n\n\n\nBut you would be too wouldn't you?

"Timely hurricane advice

All week you're going to turn on the TV and see a weather person pointing to some radar blob out in the Atlantic and making two basic meteorological points: (1) There is no need to panic. (2) We could all be killed. Yes, hurricane season is an exciting time to be in South Carolina. If you're new to the area, you're probably wondering what you need to do to prepare for the possibility that we'll get hit by ""the big one."" Based on experience, we recommend that you follow this simple three-step hurricane preparedness plan: STEP 1. Buy enough food, beer, and bottled water to last your family for at least three days. STEP 2. Put these supplies into your car. STEP 3. Drive to Nebraska and remain there until Halloween. Unfortunately, statistics show that most people will not follow this sensible plan. Most people will foolishly stay here in South Carolina. We'll start with one of the most important hurricane preparedness items: HOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE: If you own a home, you must have hurricane insurance. Fortunately, this insurance is cheap and easy to get, as long as your home meets two basic requirements: (1) It is reasonably well-built, and (2) It is located in Nebraska. Unfortunately, if your home is located in South Carolina, or any other area that might actually be hit by a hurricane, most insurance companies would prefer not to sell you hurricane insurance, because then they might be required to pay YOU money, and that is certainly not why they got into the insurance business in the first place. So you'll have to scrounge around for an insurance company, which will charge you an annual premium roughly equal to the replacement value of your house. At any moment, this company can drop you like used dental floss. Since Hurricane George, I have had an estimated 27 different home-insurance companies. This week, I'm covered by the Bob and Big Stan Insurance Company, under a policy which states that, in addition to my premium, Bob and Big Stan are entitled, on demand, to my kidneys. SHUTTERS: Your house should have hurricane shutters on all the windows, all the doors, and -- if it's a major hurricane -- all the toilets. There are several types of shutters, with advantages and disadvantages: Plywood shutters: The advantage is that, because you make them yourself, they're cheap. The disadvantage is that, because you make them yourself, they will fall off. Sheet-metal shutters: The advantage is that these work well, once you get them all up. The disadvantage is that once you get them all up, your hands will be useless bleeding stumps, and it will be December. Roll-down shutters: The advantages are that they're very easy to use, and will definitely protect your house. The disadvantage is that you will have to sell your house to pay for them. Hurricane-proof windows: These are the newest wrinkle in hurricane protection: They look like ordinary windows, but they can withstand hurricane winds! You can be sure of this, because the salesman says so. He lives in Nebraska. Hurricane Proofing Your Property: As the hurricane approaches, check your yard for movable objects like barbecue grills, planters, patio furniture, visiting relatives, etc.. You should, as a precaution, throw these items into your swimming pool (if you don't have a swimming pool, you should have one built immediately). Otherwise, the hurricane winds will turn these objects into deadly missiles. EVACUATION ROUTE: If you live in a low-lying area, you should have an evacuation route planned out. (To determine whether you live in a low-lying area, look at your driver's license; if it says ""South Carolina,"" you live in a low-lying area.) The purpose of having an evacuation route is to avoid being trapped in your home when a major storm hits. Instead, you will be trapped in a gigantic traffic jam several miles from your home, along with two hundred thousand other evacuees. So, as a bonus, you will not be lonely. HURRICANE SUPPLIES: If you don't evacuate, you will need a mess of supplies. Do not buy them now! South Carolina tradition requires that you wait until the last possible minute, then go to the supermarket and get into vicious fights with strangers over who gets the last can of SPAM. In addition to food and water, you will need the following supplies: 23 flashlights and at least $167 worth of batteries that turn out, when the power goes off, to be the wrong size for the flashlights. Bleach. (No, I don't know what the bleach is for. NOBODY knows what the bleach is for, but it's traditional, so GET some!) A 55-gallon drum of underarm deodorant. A big knife that you can strap to your leg. (This will be useless in a hurricane, but it looks cool.) A large quantity of raw chicken, to placate the alligators. (Ask anybody who went through Hugo. After the hurricane, there WILL be irate alligators.) $35,000 in cash or diamonds so that, after the hurricane passes, you can buy a generator from a man with no discernible teeth. Of course these are just basic precautions. As the hurricane draws near, it is vitally important that you keep abreast of the situation by turning on your television and watching TV reporters in rain slickers stand right next to the ocean and tell you over and over how vitally important it is for everybody to stay away from the ocean. Good luck, and remember: It's great living in Paradise. (Edit: substitute the hurricane-prone state of your choice for S Carolina. Or substitute whatever natural disaster applies to your area that your insurance company tries to get out of paying for. )",human,6y53xx,2,1504579230,0,5573,5573,953,4.847848898216159,54
"John was starting to worry about his 12 year old son Jack.

Jack was a D student, and only because John helped complete all of Jack's homework. Jack wasn't good at sports. He didn't have many friends. And it seemed like once a week he was getting called into the principal's office for some sort of misbehavior. So John told Jack, in a last ditch effort to get his son to commit to something, that Jack was going to join the school band. Jack protested, but John put his foot down. Then the next day, John got a call at the office. He answered, ""Hello?"" A voice asked, ""Is this John Robertson?"" ""Yes,"" John said. ""Jack Robertson's father?""

"Fire at Australian sausage factory (long)

One dark night in the small town of Woopwoop, W.A, a fire started inside the local sausage factory. In a blink the building was engulfed in flames.\n\nThe alarm went out to all the fire departments for miles around.\nWhen the first volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the sausage company president rushed to the fire chief and said, 'All of our secret sausage recipes are in the vault in the centre of the plant. They have to be saved, so I will donate $50,000 to the fire company that brings them out and delivers them to me.'\n\nBut the roaring flames held the firefighters off. Soon more fire departments had to be called in because the situation became desperate.\n\nAs the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer to extricate the secret recipes was now $100,000 to the fire department that could save them.\n\nSuddenly from up the road, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the fire engine of the nearby Baringa volunteer fire department composed mainly of Aboriginal firefighters over the age of 65.\n\nTo everyone's amazement, the little run-down fire engine, operated by these Aboriginal firefighters, passed the fire engines parked outside the plant, and drove straight into the middle of the inferno.\n\nOutside, the other firemen watched in amazement as the Aboriginal old timers jumped off and began to fight the fire as if they were fighting to save their own lives..Within a short time, the Baringa old timers had extinguished the fire and saved the secret recipes.\n\nThe grateful sausage company president joyfully announced that for such a superhuman accomplishment he was raising the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave elderly Aboriginal firefighters.\n\nA TV news crew rushed in after capturing the event on film. The 'on camera' reporter asked the Aboriginal fire chief, 'What are you going to do with all that money?''\n\nWell,' said Chief Billy Cokebottle, the 70-year-old fire chief, 'de first ting we gonnna do is fix dem brakes on dat farkin old truck, eh!!'",ai,ai_3480,0,0,1,2126,2126,348,5.109195402298851,17

His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n\nSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n\nAnd on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... \n\nAnd the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n\nAnd on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n\nSuddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.\n\nThe townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.\n\nThe mayor approached the lead monk of the order. \""What happened?\"" he asked, exasperated.\n\nThe old monk shook his head sadly. \""Isn't it obvious?\"" he said. \""Sam sung Note 7.\""\n\n\n\n\n\n- EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up!

Then I came to know that we can ask about many things you want to find. The first thing that clicked my mind was that show. So I made a post asking about Where can I find the OST of that show. I got many answers like YT, Spotify but I had searched every place and that music was nowhere. I was desperate to find that music as I know my days are near. Then after many moons, I got a notification on that post. With a surprise I read that comment. It was of a girl. That comment told me to search for that music on r/Jokes. I was amazed. Why on earth r/Jokes started giving OSTs and songs and music. I asked her for the reason.

Bob Hill and his new wife, Betty, are vacationing in Europe, near Transylvania. They re driving in a rental car along a rather deserted highway. It is late, raining very hard and Bob can barely see the road in front of the car. Suddenly, the car skids out of control. Bob attempts to control it, but to no avail. The car swerves and smashes into a ditch.. Moments later, Bob shakes his head to clear the fog. Dazed, he looks over at the passenger seat and sees Betty unconscious, with her head bleeding. Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to get her medical assistance. He carefully picks her up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light and heads towards it, which is coming from a large, old house. He approaches the door and knocks. A small, hunched man opens the door. Bob blurts, “Hello, my name is Bob Hill and this is my wife Betty. We’ve been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been Seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone?” “I’m sorry,” replies the hunchback, “but we don’t have a phone. My master is a doctor. Come in, and I will get him.” Bob brings his wife in. An older man comes down the stairs. “I’m afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor; I am a scientist. However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had some basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory.” With that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab. Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table. After a brief examination, Igor’s master looks worried. “Things are serious, Igor.

Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. It is here that he has always found solace and he begins to play. A stirring, almost haunting melody fills the house. Meanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up. His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty’s hand twitch, keeping time to the haunting piano music. Stunned, he watches as Bob’s arm begins to rise, marking the beat. He is further amazed as Betty and Bob both sit up straight! Unable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory.

Getting rid of useless skin that’s attached to you is the 'in' thing to do these days, you know (no, I’m not talking about Kayne). Of course, she would like everyone involved in the operation to keep the affair highly confidential and asks the doctors and nurses to maintain complete secrecy. After the procedure, she wakes up in the recovery ward and to her utter shock finds 3 huge bouquets of flowers, apparently from well-wishers. ""Nurse! Get in here immediately!"" she demands. The nurse scurries in and asks how she can assist. ""I expressly asked that no one know about my surgery!"" she exclaims. ""Who are all these flowers from?!"" ""Oh, sorry"" explains the nurse. ""We were all just so excited to see you here, the team of nurses and doctors just thought it would be nice to offer you some flowers to wish you a speedy recovery."" ""Hmmph. And what about the other bunch over there!"" she barks as she gestures at the second bouquet. ""Oh, that's from Kanye, he also wishes you well and said he'll be here shortly."" ""And what about THAT bunch!"" she says as she motions at the third beautiful arrangement. ""Oh, that's from a guy in the burns unit. He'd like to thank the person who donated him his new ears.""",human,4kdfp0,1,1463835033,0,1335,1335,241,4.539419087136929,17

"Old School Pirate Crime

Captain Normal Beard the up-and-coming pirate captain and his first mate Clumsy Edward were in desperate need of ink in order to make the numerous treasure maps they were sure create during all of their treasure-filled journeys. More than anything they needed red ink for the illustrious X's that will mark the location of the unbound riches of their future. A well known calligrapher lived in the area and Clumsy Edward knew just how to get their much-needed red ink! ""Put ye hands out and I can vault into the window he keeps open, Cap'n. In an out real quick-like, sir! Ink an everything!"" Clumsy Edward's plan was foolproof. The night had come and Captain Normal Beard and Clumsy Edward were outside the calligrapher's home. All according to plan, the window the duo had planned to use was open and the home was dark. Normal Beard interlocked his fingers as if he'd done it hundreds of times before and Edward was in the window in no time. Here's where the issue arises. Clumsy Edward, claiming his name once again, had only put enough forethought into the operation to get into the window. He was unaware of the layout of the small one-room home the calligrapher lived in. He was incredibly unaware that the calligrapher did all of his work right under the window and that he had neglected to put away his work from earlier the night. Clumsy Edward falls through the window and lands onto the table with a loud crash, alerting the neighboring citizens. ""Argh, I done crash't into the table an spill't the ink, Cap'n! I'm cover't innit!"" Upon hearing the commotion a nearby group of men ran to the scene to find Clumsy Edward leaving the home covered in ink. Black ink on his face. Blue across his entire torso. Red ink covering his arms and hands. Unfortunately, Clumsy Edward and Captain Normal Beard's dream to be wealthy pirates was known to the community and no one believed that Clumsy Edward would do something of his own fruition. After the fallout of their plan, Captain Normal Beard went to the local tavern to attempt to drown his sorrows unaware of the fate that befell his matey. Mid-drink Clumsy Edward was thrown into the tavern followed by his captors. Upon making eye contact with his Captain, Edward immediately and profusely apologized. Seeing this, Edward's captors seized Captain Normal Beard and showed him the evidence against him. The black ink on Edward's face. The Blue in across his torso. And finally, the red ink covering his arms and hands. ""We believe Edward here to have broken into the calligrapher's home with your instruction, Normal Beard. What do ye say to these accusations?"" Captain Normal Beard was completely stunned, unable to come up with a good reason for their predicament. Normal Beard knew that he and his matey had been caught and they would surely hang for destruction and theft. His dream of becoming a pirate was over before it started to come to fruition. Being a man of his word, never lying, yet still sour over the outcome of the night said but one thing to the men.. ""Aye, we did the deed.. An I woulda got away wit it too, had ye not caught me Red Hand Ed!"" **EDIT:** First post, long time redditor. I was unaware as to how long this would be. I just thought of the punchline and came up with a story on the fly. I hope at least one person gets a chuckle out of it, although I doubt it warrants a laugh or a bellow with how lengthy it is and how weak the punch is. Nevertheless, hope someone enjoys it and ANY criticism is more than welcomed. I have aspirations to possibly become a stand up comic, but of course not with jokes like this seeing as how it is far from suited for that kind of venue. Any way to shorten this joke is also extremely welcome. More so than any criticism, whether it be constructive or not. *Post Edit TL;DR* A pirate captain, Normal Beard, and his matey, Clumsy Edward, attempt to steal ink to make treasure maps. They break into a calligrapher's home with the matey clumsily falling and getting covered in ink, in particular, red ink on his arms and hands. The matey is caught and brought to the pirate captain by his captors who then interrogate the captain of his suspected crimes, bringing up the ink on his cohorts arms and hands. Being a man who doesn't lie, yet is still flustered the captain proclaims, """"Aye, we did the deed.. An I woulda got away wit it too, had ye not caught me Red Hand Ed!"" *Post Edit TL;DR Edit* It seems I just shortened my joke for myself... Which version do you like better?

"The Last Ride

\""Congratulations! You can now handle this route on your own. Remember the company's protocol\"", Bobbie beamed as he finished assessing Dave's performance for Bus Service 13. \""Enjoy the night events following the route\"", Bobbie mischievously hinted at Dave, his junior who had just joined the company.\n\n\nToday, Dave steeled his nerves. He will be on his own, handling the midnight \""last bus\"" schedule for Service 13, a long but important service, as it serviced a massive industrial area. Of course it's a bustling service in the day, with workers to and fro. As part of regulation, the company has to operate the service even till midnight where there's usually no passengers. Oddly, his only assignment will be to drive this service at this timing, and nothing else. Noone else in the company was jealous of his work but Dave cast aside those thoughts.\n\n\nSatisfied with the initial inspection of the double-decker bus, he started on his journey from the depot. With only the scenes of forest edges flying by, he examined quiet roads and empty pathways but an eerie feeling crept up as he passed a dilapidated graveyard. The government planned to exhume the site to pave way for more industrial projects, or at least that was what he had read in the papers.\n\n\nApproaching the start of the industrial area, he wondered if there'll be anyone boarding the bus. As expected, there was noone in the multitude of bus-stops he passed. As the last few factories loomed before him, he noticed someone at a bus-stop.\n\n\nIt was an old lady, dressed simply in a white dress, her dishevelled hair blocking her face, but two things were apparent. She held out her hand flagging the bus but her eyes were transfixed on something above. Specifically, the upper deck of the bus.\n\n\nDave slowed down, feeling slightly nervous and as he approaches, the figure maintained her position but her gaze never strayed. Confident that the person was physically there, he stopped and the woman boarded, her face distraught.\n\n\n\""I have never seen so many people up there at this time, it must be because today's Friday the 13th\"", she shivered. Dave was dumbfounded as she took her seat beside the stairwell leading to the upper deck. Indeed today was Friday 13th as he eyed the woman through the rear view mirror. She was 5 seats away from him but her fear was contagious. Dave had goosebumps as he pulled off.\n\n\n\""I'm sorry madam, but what do you mean people up there? You're the first passenger\"", Dave inquired, trying to quench his curiousity.\n\n\n\""Nothing nothing! I can hear them stomping above as though they're trying to shush me\"", the woman squeaked as she clasped her hand in prayer.\n\n\nDave was mortified. He kept looking at the CCTV monitor panel but there was noone in the upper decks. His fear was somewhat relieved as they entered the residential zone and 13 stops later, the woman buzzed the stop. Dave couldn't believe his eyes when the woman ran fleeing out of the bus at her stop. Her face displayed pure agony as she turned back for the last time to look at the bus before disappearing into the shadows of the houses.\n\n\nDave controlled his breathing and continued driving. It was only a few stops away till the final depot, so he must see this journey to the end. Still, he kept peeking at the CCTV monitors to be sure but nothing happened as he ended his work for the day.\n\n\n\nDave didn't tell anyone what happened as he turned up for work the next day. Perhaps it was an anomaly, there was no point in looking like a mad man after just a day's work. He checked the bus and headed out for the journey.\n\n\nThe same start as yesterday and again at the same stop, there appeared the lady again. She looked the same, save for her change of clothes but still her gaze was transfixed on the upper deck.\n\n\n\""Today's less busy... but there's a hulking presence amongst them\"", she whispered as she sat further way from Dave, nearer the exit doors.\n\n\nChill went down his spine. Was there a murderous intent above that he didn't notice? He scanned the monitors just to be safe but he couldn't see anything. Even Dave who didn't believe in the supernatural, was starting to question his beliefs, as he noticed the woman sobbing in her seat.\n\n\nAs if a replay of last night's activities, the woman sprung out and ran when they reached her stop. She didn't even look back.\n\n\nThese series of events repeated themselves as Dave drove the service for more than a year. He thought he could get used to it but he just couldn't. Different nights, different terrors. It has gotten to the point that the woman now regularly sat on the exit door steps, clutching to the walls, sniffling her cries.\n\n\n\""There's something on the roof\"", \""I can hear them trying to go down the stairwells\"", \""Stop looking into the upper deck, they're restless\"", \""We're damned in this service\"", \""I hope you're praying as hard as me, it's the only way to resist\"", \""Stop crying and wailing, stop! Stop, I can't help you!!!\"", \""God bless me please!\"", all manners of horrified speeches were said by the woman, either directed to him or to the dwelling above.\n\n\n\n\""I pray you are safe!\"", \""God bless your soul\"", \""Be safe\"", sometimes she would say that to Dave before she alighted. Dave hated it when she said parting words because it hinted a terrifying presence.\n\n\nAnd then one day it stopped.\n\n\nThe lady stopped appearing.\n\n\nThe same day the government had also begun exhuming the sites and transferring the remains to another mortuary.\n\n\nDave rue the day he started noticing her absence. She was the only company he had in this damned service route.\n\n\nHe kept checking the CCTV above, afraid of the unknown. He started praying from the moment he start the journey. He brought books of faith, talisman, charms and even turned to vegetarian diet to rid himself of bad karma. But whatever he did, the pressure behind him grew and grew. \n\n\nWithout the woman, things had started to go awry. He didn't notice them at first but he thought he could start seeing the negativities himself. Flickers in the CCTV monitor, he felt the temperature drop, opposing cars high beamed him, and it started to affect his driving. He would narrowly avoid collision with structures while checking the monitors. He would unconciously speed up and beat red lights when in the vicinity of the violated graveyard.\n\n\n2 months of this has taken a toll on Dave. He had nightmares every night, images of dark shadows consuming the interior of the bus. In just the short period, Dave had lost a lot of weight, he looked gaunt and his eyes lifeless. His concerned wife pulled him aside and just said she loved him, their children loved him, and if work was the reason he had become like this, he should find another job.\n\n\nDave spent the morning thinking about this. The job paid well since it was night hours, it was only 1 route and he had never fell ill in the past year, despite his horror experiences. It was only after the lady disappeared that things have taken a physical toll on him. He concluded that she was part of his divine protection. He had made up his mind. He will tender his resignation.\n\n\n\nIn front of his superiors, Dave explained his reasons for quitting. He didn't care if they didn't believed him, and he even turned down their offer for a raise. They must know something, that must be why they want to keep me. Without anyone else wanting to run the midnight bus service 13, the company could face a legal repercussion. In the end, they had to call back Bobbie, the only person who had drove that route before Dave. In fact, Bobbie drove exclusively that route for more than a decade, never taking a day off.\n\n\nDave took his leave and lo and behold, he met Bobbie outside the office. \n\n\nBobbie exlaimed his surprise, \""I heard you're resigning? But why?\""\n\n\n\""I couldn't continue working that route after the only passenger, this lady, I don't know anything about her, but after she stopped apeparing, I just don't have the will to continue\"", Dave said.\n\n\n\""That's... a damn shame! She was the only reason why I had agreed to come back! My ailing eyesight was why the company transferred me to day shift. But if I had a choice, I would have stayed on service 13! But now that she's gone... it's all over\"", Bobbie wept.\n\n\nBobbie continued hopelessly, \""Now who's gonna accompany me in that night ride...\"".\n\n\n\""I understand what you meant Bobbie. In hindsight, she was also the reason why I stayed. She was my protector, my guardian angel\"", Dave sighed.\n\n\n\""What the fuck are you talking about?\"", quizzed Bobbie suddenly.\n\n\nDave told his stories to a bewildered Bobbie, who kept quiet the whole time.\n\n\n\""That foxy vixen... I guess she must have retired from her company\"" mumbled Bobbie.\n\n\nNoticing the shocked look plastered on Dave's face.\n\n\nBobbie chuckled, \""I guess she'll really do anything to avoid paying the bus fare\"".",ai,ai_4210,0,0,1,9017,9017,1522,4.924441524310118,101

So there's this donut and his birthday is today. It's Sunday and the donut says to himself...""You know what I think I'm going to take the day off and go enjoy myself."" The Donut hasn't taken time off in about 3 months so he decides that he's going to go spend the day down at the local pier. So he goes to the pier and starts rolling around or whatever donuts do. He's at the pier for several hours before a man walks up to him and says ""Hey you know I've seen you rolling around here for a while, do you need help with something?"" The donut replies to the man ""It's my birthday today and I'm not sure what I want to do."" The man laughs and says to the donut ""you know I heard there's a cruise ship pulling out of here in a couple hours...if you make it down to the travel agency I'm sure you can grab a ticket and have yourself a few days to relax!"" The donut replies ""you know what? That's a great idea, I think I'll do just that...yeah I could use a few days off from work."" The donut quickly runs back home packs his bags and gets a ticket from the travel agency and boards the cruise ship ecstatic for his journey. ""Wow, this is amazing!"" the donut says. The donut's having a great time on the cruise, he's rolling around the decks, tanning in the sun, sprinkles blowing in the wind...whatever it is donuts do to have fun. So the donut gets this great idea all of a sudden...""gee it's my birthday today, I think I'll ask the captain if he'll let me drive the ship...after all it is my birthday! That's not a bad idea, why not?!"" So the donut goes up to the bridge and says ""Captain Captain it's my birthday today can you please let me drive the ship."" The Captain says ""No get the fuck out of here!"" and he kicks the donut out. The donut looks confused and goes back to his cabin for a bit...then he says to himself ""you know what? I bet the Captain was just really busy when I went up there, I'll just go up there and ask him again. He definitely won't turn me down this time!"" So the donut goes back up to the bridge again and says to the Captain ""Captain Captain can you please let me drive the boat, it's my birthday today I'd love to drive the boat!"" The Captain says ""No, get the fuck out of here, if you come up here again I'll have you thrown overboard!"" Again, the donut looks disappointed and returns to his cabin and takes a nap for a few hours. He wakes up and says to himself ""You know, the Captain must have been really busy earlier! If I go back up there now and ask to drive the boat there's no way he'll turn me down! He just can't!"" The donut rolls off eager as always and makes his way to the bridge. He rolls into the bridge and says ""Captain Captain will you please let me drive the boat?"" &nbsp; &nbsp; What do you think happens next? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *The Captain threw the Donut overboard.* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So a man decides he's going to propose to his girlfriend, he's absolutely in love with this girl so he's got the perfect proposal planned.

So he finally feels like it's time to propose...he bought her the most expensive beautiful ring that he hand picked at the jewelry store. He spent his entire life savings on this ring. He reaches out into his back pocket and as he goes to get down on one knee to propose he slips and drops the ring over the bluff into the water...gone forever. His whole life savings wasted away. His girlfriend looks at him and says ""You know what, I love you and I want to marry you anyway. I know it'll be hard but we can make it work!"" So a couple weeks pass by and the couple have been having to work long hours to pay their bills. They decide that they should go out for a nice expensive date to relax from all the extra work they've been doing to make up for the ring he bought. The man takes his fiance out to a nice expensive seafood restauraunt and he orders himself a nice lobster and she orders a plate of hot steamy oysters.

So a C, an E-flat and a G walk into a bar. The bartender says, \""sorry, but we don't serve minors.\"" So E-flat leaves, and C and G have an open fifth between them.

"Fire at Australian sausage factory (long)

One dark night in the small town of Woopwoop, W.A, a fire started inside the local sausage factory. In a blink the building was engulfed in flames. The alarm went out to all the fire departments for miles around. When the first volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the sausage company president rushed to the fire chief and said, 'All of our secret sausage recipes are in the vault in the centre of the plant. They have to be saved, so I will donate $50,000 to the fire company that brings them out and delivers them to me.' But the roaring flames held the firefighters off. Soon more fire departments had to be called in because the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer to extricate the secret recipes was now $100,000 to the fire department that could save them. Suddenly from up the road, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the fire engine of the nearby Baringa volunteer fire department composed mainly of Aboriginal firefighters over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, the little run-down fire engine, operated by these Aboriginal firefighters, passed the fire engines parked outside the plant, and drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other firemen watched in amazement as the Aboriginal old timers jumped off and began to fight the fire as if they were fighting to save their own lives..Within a short time, the Baringa old timers had extinguished the fire and saved the secret recipes. The grateful sausage company president joyfully announced that for such a superhuman accomplishment he was raising the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave elderly Aboriginal firefighters. A TV news crew rushed in after capturing the event on film. The 'on camera' reporter asked the Aboriginal fire chief, 'What are you going to do with all that money?'' Well,' said Chief Billy Cokebottle, the 70-year-old fire chief, 'de first ting we gonnna do is fix dem brakes on dat farkin old truck, eh!!'",human,9cgrki,5,1535932919,0,2098,2098,358,4.860335195530726,17

"The Clown Joke (WARNING: Very Long)

Once upon a time – which is a terrible way to start a joke – there was a little boy named Billy. \n\nBilly was six years old, and for the whole of his short life, he had been utterly and intensely obsessed with clowns. He had clown bed sheets and clown posters; he had clown toys and clown-themed games; he had towels with clowns on them, a toothbrush in the shape of a clown, and – if it had existed – he probably would have used clown-flavored toothpaste, as well.\n\nTry not to think about it.\n\nThe point here is that Billy loved clowns, and his parents were well aware of that fact. (They'd have to be, right? I mean, how is a six-year-old going to buy all of that stuff on his own?) Thus, they decided that for their son's seventh birthday, they'd purchase front-row seats at the circus, which *just happened* to be in town at the same time. Upon hearing this, Billy was absolutely overcome with excitement, and he was scarcely able to sit still until his family arrived at the big top.\n\nBilly and his parents walked in, took their seats, and waited for the show to start. \n\nThe music flared to life and the lights came up, and in a dazzling display of merriment, everything began. First came the lion-tamers with their whips and chairs... and yeah, they were intriguing, but they didn't hold Billy's interest. Next came the feats of strength with strongmen (and one excessively suspicious woman) smashing bricks and bending bars... and yeah, it was impressive, but Billy didn't really care. The sword swallowers followed, and the trapeze artists, and the tightrope walkers... and yeah, someone might have died at any moment, but it all seemed so *boring*.\n\nEventually, Billy began to worry that he wouldn't get to see clowns at the circus. After all, he knew very well that clowns usually only appeared when something went wrong. (You didn't know that, did you? Yeah, clowns are typically kept on standby in case someone screws up.) \n\nSuddenly, all of the lights went out.\n\nA single spotlight shown down to one corner of the arena.\n\nA tiny car came puttering into view, while discordant, almost forlorn circus music played.\n\n*Deet deet deedle-deedle deet deet dee deeeeee...*\n\nThe car's doors sprang open, and out poured the most amazing collection of clowns that Billy had ever seen! There were fat clowns, thin clowns, tall clowns, short clowns! Clowns with bright red hair and enormous red noses! Clowns in silly suspenders and oversize shoes! There were clowns wearing every color of the rainbow, and clowns that moved like psychotic ferrets on speed! There were more clowns than Billy had ever *dreamed* of watching all at once!\n\nThen, just as it seemed like that tiny car couldn't produce a single soul more, another clown stepped out. He was too fat to be thin, yet too thin to be fat... but somehow wasn't average, either. He was too short too be tall, yet too tall to be short... but still managed to be both at once. He had pale, almost white skin – not the product of makeup – and deep, almost black, sunken eyes. He had a shock of bright red (and completely natural) hair, and a bulbous, equally red nose.\n\nBilly looked on with awe and wonder as he realized what he was seeing: This wasn't a person in makeup who was putting on an act; this was a *real clown*. The man – if indeed you could call him a man – reached into the front of his pants, wiggled his hand around for a little while, and pulled forth a bright silver microphone. After offering a conspiratorial wink to the audience, the clown cleared his throat... and his dry, raspy voice boomed out for everyone to hear:\n\n\""I need a volunteer!\""\n\n**[Continued](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3wmv58/the_clown_joke_warning_very_long/cxxdzc6)**...",ai,ai_8349,0,0,1,3792,3792,642,4.906542056074766,35

A man working at the Federal Reserve was hired to manufacture pennies. On his first day, the supervisor walked him around the manufacturing area. \n\n“This first machine melts down large blocks of metal. The liquid metal is then poured into a mold that makes a smaller block. That smaller block is then taken off the conveyer belt by this control arm and placed on another conveyer belt. The conveyer belt rolls the smaller block into a machine that cuts the block into evenly-sized cubes. Those cubes are individually melted down again and poured into a mold with 25 slots that shape the tails side of the penny. Each penny is then stamped on the other side with the heads side, which completes the penny. All of the pennies are cooled, rolled, and stored for shipping. If you have no more questions, then come back tomorrow for your first day of work.” \n\nThe next morning, the supervisor walks in to see a totally new machine melting metal and stamping pennies.

“Once again, the earth has become wicked and over-populated, and I see the end of all flesh before me.\""\n\n\""Build another Ark and save 2 of every living thing along with a few good humans.\""\n\nHe gave Noah the blueprints, saying:\n\n\""You have 6 months to build the Ark before I will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights.\""\n\nSix months later, the Lord looked down and saw Noah weeping in his yard - but no Ark.\""Noah!,\"" He roared, \""I'm about to start the rain! Where is the Ark?\""\n\n\""Forgive me, Lord,\"" begged Noah, \""but things have changed.\""\n\n\""I needed a Building Permit.\""\n\n\""I've been arguing with the Boat Inspector about the need for a sprinkler system.\""\n\n\""My homeowners association claim that I've violated the\n\nNeighborhood by-laws by building the Ark in my back yard and exceeding the height limitations. We had to go to the local Planning Committee for a decision.\""\n\n\""Then the City Council and the Electricity Company demanded a shed load of money for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions, to clear the passage for the Ark's move to the sea. I told them that the sea would be coming to us, but they would hear none of it.\""\n\n\""Getting the wood was another problem. There's a ban on cutting local trees in order to save the Greater Spotted Barn Owl.\""\n\n\""I tried to convince the environmentalists that I needed the wood to save the owls - but no go!\""\n\n\""When I started gathering the animals, PETA took me to court. They insisted that I was confining wild animals against their will. They argued the accommodations were too restrictive and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space.\""\n\n\""Then the Environmental Protection Agency ruled that I couldn't build the Ark until they'd conducted an environmental impact study on Your proposed flood.\""\n\n\""I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on how many minorities I'm supposed to hire for my building crew.\""\n\n\""The Immigration Dept. Is checking the visa status of most of the people who want to work.\""\n\n\""The labor unions say I can't use my sons. They insist I have to hire only union workers with ark-building experience.\""\n\n\""To make matters worse, the IRS seized all my assets, claiming I'm trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species.\""\n\n\""So, forgive me, Lord, but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish this ark.\""\n\n\""Suddenly the skies cleared, the sun began to shine and a rainbow stretched across the sky.\""\n\nNoah looked up in wonder and asked, \""You mean you're not going to destroy the world?\""\n\n\""No,\"" said the Lord. \"" The Government beat me to it.",ai,ai_794,0,0,1,2788,2788,457,5.100656455142232,27

"Alerts to Threats in Europe

The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent events in Syria and have therefore raised their security level from “Miffed” to “Peeved.” Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to “Irritated” or even “A Bit Cross.” The English have not been “A Bit Cross” since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorized from “Tiresome” to “A Bloody Nuisance.” The last time the British issued a “Bloody Nuisance” warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada. The Scots have raised their threat level from “Pissed Off” to “Let’s get the Bastards.” They don’t have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years. The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from “Run” to “Hide.” The only two higher levels in France are “Collaborate” and “Surrender.” The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France ‘s white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country’s military capability. Italy has increased the alert level from “Shout Loudly and Excitedly” to “Elaborate Military Posturing.” Two more levels remain: “Ineffective Combat Operations” and “Change Sides.” The Germans have increased their alert state from “Disdainful Arrogance” to “Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.” They also have two higher levels: “Invade a Neighbour” and “Lose.” Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels . The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy. Australia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from “No worries” to “She’ll be alright, Mate.” Two more escalation levels remain: “Crikey! I think we’ll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!” and “The barbie is cancelled.” So far no situation has ever warranted use of the last final escalation level. A final thought – ” Greece is collapsing, the Iranians are getting aggressive, and Rome is in disarray. Welcome back to 430 BC”.",human,7i3pqn,85,1512618221,0,2243,2243,373,5.013404825737266,23

"My favourite disappointing joke

A man walks into a bar and the bar keeper says ""Can I get you a drink?"" The man looks at the barkeep and says ""If I can show you the most amazing thing you've ever seen, will you give me free drinks for the rest of the night?"" The barkeep thinks about it for a moment and says ""Sounds interesting but I warn you that I'm not easily impressed. Lets see it then"". The man reaches into his bag an produces a tiny, perfect piano and a stool. The barkeep admires the craftsmanship and says ""Cool toy but I'm not into doll houses"". The man raises a finger of acknowledgement and reaches back into his bag before producing a dwarf hamster dressed in a tiny tuxedo and places it gently onto the stool. ""Cute,"" says the barkeep ""but I've seen better"". The man feeds a sunflower seed to the hamster and after stuffing it into his cheek the hamster turns to the piano and starts to play some of the most beautiful music the barkeep has ever heard. ""Wow"" says the wide eyed barkeep ""That's pretty good, but I've seen better."" The man lets out an exasperated sigh and reaches deeper into his bag before producing a big green frog and sitting it on the bar next to the hamster and his piano. The barkeep raises an eyebrow as the man bends down and appears to whisper something to the hamster before handing over two seeds. The hamster gleefully stuffs the seeds into its mouth before striking up a different tune on the piano and as if by magic the frog starts singing the most sonorous and powerful operatic performance in time with the piano. By this point a crowd of stunned onlookers has gathered around the bar, the barkeep can't believe the spectacle taking place in front of his eyes and as soon as the performance finishes he turns to the man and says ""That's incredible, your drinks are on the house"". The man orders a beer and starts to carefully put the show back in his bag. The barkeep returns with his order and says ""Look, I'd be a fool if I didn't ask if you could be tempted into selling your little show, how much do you want for it? The man sips his beer and replies politely ""Sorry, the creatures are my pets and I won't sell them"" before moving to a corner table for the rest of the evening where he quietly enjoys his free beers by himself. The night eventually draws to a close and the barkeep rings the bell for last orders. The man returns to the bar to order a final drink, the memory of that show has been twirling around the barkeeps mind all night and as he returns with the mans order he decides to make one last offer. ""I know you said they weren't for sale but I've got $2000 worth of tips upstairs that I was saving, it's obvious you've got no money otherwise you'd not be making deals in bars like this so how about it, can we make a deal?"" He says to the man. The man takes a big sip of his beer and looks into space as if deep in thought. After a moment he sighs deeply and says ""Well, I'm trying to get to the big city where I can make some real money but things are getting pretty tight on the road and the show's not worth anything if I never make to the big city at all so I guess we can talk"". The man reaches into his bag and puts the ensemble back on the bar where he sits and studies them while mumbling quietly to himself about years, numbers, training and occasionally counting on his fingers. He eventually stops, takes a deep breath and begins to explain. ""Well the piano took me 4yrs to build and several hundred in materials so that's off the table straight away, the hamster took 5yrs to train and has been a well mannered, loyal friend on the road and I don't think I could part with him but the frog has only been with me for a year and has been foul mouthed and nothing but trouble so I potentially be tempted to offload him for just a little bit more. I'm not a fool and I know what these creatures are worth."" The barkeep ponders this for a moment before disappearing upstairs and returning with the jar of tips, he places it on the bar and opens the cash register, he counts out another $500 and pushes the money towards the man. ""$2500 should take you anywhere in the country first class, it's yours for the frog."" The man looks pained for a moment and stares at the frog before looking at the cash, he looks back and forth a few times trying to make his decision before eventually saying ""Deal"" and tucking the money into his bag. ""Great!"" says the barkeep ""A pleasure doing business with you"". The man takes one long last look at the frog before walking towards the exit. As he proceeds an elderly patron who had been watching them all evening gets up and follows him out the door. ""Excuse me"" the patron says ""Could you hold on a minute?"" ""Sure, what's up?"" say the man. ""I just wanted a final look at the stupidest man on earth as he parts with his fortune!"" sneers the elderly man ""You could have made millions with that little show of yours!"" ""Yeah I do kinda feel like a dick, I should've-"" The man starts to reply ""You should feel like a dick!"" The old patron interrupts ""You should have thought about the big picture, you kids these days never thi-"" The man reaches up and gently presses a finger to the old patrons lips silencing him. ""I should have told him that the hamster is a ventriloquist.""",human,euo23p,8,1580132586,0,5283,5283,1003,4.267198404785643,33

"An average father gives his average son.....

....a ping pong table for his 12th birthday, and to his surprise the son loves ping pong. Plays it every day and night, and when no friends or family wants to play a round with him the kid sets up the table against a wall and pracices with himself.\n\nAfter a few years the father notices that his son is playing ping pong less and less, He asks him about this and the son replies, \""Can't. No more ping pong balls\"". The father looks and just like his son had told him there were no longer any balls left on the table. \""OK\"", he thought, he lost them. No big deal.\n\nApproaching the sons 14th birthday the father decides he wants to do something extra special. He finds his son watching TV and says, \""Son! It's almost your 14th birthday! What kind of bike would you like?!\"". The son (without moving his head away from the TV) just replies, \""NO Bike dad, I want ping pong balls\"". The father was a little taken back by this, he continued and asked, \""What do you mean? You don't want a bike son? You're turning 14?!?!\"". The son made further comment and just returned to his program.\n\nWell this wasn't going to fly the father thought. You know what.. I'm buying him the damn bike! So the father goes to the local sporting goods store and picks his son out a nice stylish bike with all of the shocks and removable doo dads he can get. He also decides to get him a few packs of ping pong balls and throw them in the helmet hanging from the handlebars.\n\nThe morning of his sons birthday the father sets up the bike with a big ribbon then goes off to work. Returning home the father finds the bike sitting in the living room seemingly untouched. The bow is still on it, the kick stand still in the perfect little carpet divit it created from this morning. .. but .. all of the ping pong balls were gone. The father assumes the son must be playing ping pong! But to his surprise he finds him in his bedroom playing on his game console.\n\nThe father asks the son, \""Son! What is wrong with the bike? don't you like it?\""\n\n\""Yea dad, good bike, great bike, love the bike\"", replies the son.\n\nthe father can't help but question; \""so what happened to the ping pong balls\"". but the son ignores him. The father assumes his son lost the balls already and is too embarrased to tell him so drops the subject and moves on.\n\nthe next year for the boys 15th birthday the father decides he wants him to have a new computer. Knowing this isn't something you can just buy for someone he asks his son, \""Son! What kind of computer would you like for your birthday?\"". The son answers shortly, \""No computer, Ping pong balls\"". The father thinks this is a bit odd but knows how much his son enjoys ping pong so doesn't say anything else about the subject.\n\nAfter buying the new computer for his son and setting it up the father (again) tosses a few packages of ping pong balls in with the present and off to work he goes. 5pm rolls around and the father returns home to find the computer hasn't even been started up. His son is sitting in the living room listening to music and the ping pong balls have all dissapeared.\n\nThis time the father wants answers; he says to the son \""Son! What was wrong with the computer?\""\n\n\""Nothing dad, good computer, great computer, love the computer\"", replies the son.\n\nOK thinks the father, \""Also what happened to the ping pong balls?\"".\n\nThe son doesn't reply, going back to his music he ignores the father. Being a good trustworthy son in the past the father decides to let this drop. If his son didn't like the presents he's sure he would tell him.\n\nApproaching the sons 16th birthday the father thinks, \""Ok this is the year! I will finally give him a present he won't be able to ignore! I'll buy him a car!\"". The father finds the son and says \""Son! What kind of car do you want for your birthday?\"" The son replies to the father with the same reply he's been giving for all occasions from 12 until now, \""Dad, I want ping pong balls\"". \""What?!\"" exclaims the father, \""You are turning 16! you are getting a car!\"".\n\nBeing a little annoyed now the father decides to pull a fast one on his son, After buying him a new car he decided to prank his son and fill it from floor to sunroof with thousands of ping pong balls. He put them in the trunk, the vents, the glove box, under the seats.. everywhere.. Pushed the car into the drive way with a big bow on it and off to work he went.\n\nDriving upto the house after work the father notices the car doors are open, so is the trunk. As he gets closed he also notices the bow and ribbons were still on the car... It hadn't been moved! AND ALL OF THE PING PONG BALLS ARE GONE! \""Ok\"" he says to himself. \""He's good\""\n\nThinking his son just taught him a lesson on pranking the father walks into the house expecting a pie in the face or to be drowned in his own ping pong ball joke... instead his son is just sitting at the computer chatting on MSN.\n\n\""Son! Don't you like the car!?\"" yells the father.\n\n\""Yea dad, good car, great car, love the car\"", replies the son.\n\n\""Well WTF happened to the ping pong balls?!\"" the father almost screams.\n\nBut again, the son just ignores his father. The father dismisses this as his son just trying to get under his skin for the innital prank and once again ignores it.\n\nSo a few years have passed and for every occasion the son is asked what he would like his reply is only ever \""ping pong balls\"". Unfortunatly for the son, around his mid 30's he's diagnosed with a terminal illness and is laying on his death bed.\n\n\""Son\"", walks in the father, \""You are not long of this world. Is there anything I can do for you or get you to make you more comfortable? Pictures of loved ones? Sweets? Anything?\"". The son looking very weak and pale says, \""ping pong balls dad... ping pong balls.\"" The father doesn't even argue this time; he runs down to the gift shop and gets a basket and fills it with sweets, flowers, goes into his wallet and pulls out all of the family photos and by sure dumb luck there is a 5 pack of ping pong balls in the gift shop so he buys that as well.\n\nReturning to the room the father gives the basket to his son and kisses him on the forehead. He turns around and asks the nurse a question, only to find when he turned back that ALL OF THE PING PONG BALLS WERE GONE! This does it: \""Son?\"" asks the father.\n\n\""Yes dad\""\n\n\""Have I been a good father to you?\"" the father questions.\n\n\""Yes dad, you've been a good dad, great dad. I love you dad.\""\n\n\""Then can I ask you one thing before our time is up?\"".\n\n\""Yes dad, anything.\"" says the son. Looking very weak now.\n\n\""Ok, well, I just wanted to know after all of these years. What happened to all of the ping pong balls?\"" said the father.\n\n\""Ok dad... I'll tell you.\"" and the son took a deep breath.\n\nThen he died.",ai,ai_1877,0,0,1,6903,6903,1262,4.469889064976228,80

"How the Internet Started, According to the Bible

In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com did take unto himself a healthy young wife by the name of Dorothy. And Dot Com was a comely woman, large of breast, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com. And she said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?"" And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How, dear?"" And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale, and they will reply telling you who hath the best price. The sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)."" Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent. To prevent neighboring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew. It was known as Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS), and she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures - Hebrew to the People (HTTP). And the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS. And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. Indeed he did insist on drums to be made that would work only with Brother Gates' drum heads and drumsticks. And Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others."" And Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known. He said, ""We need a name that reflects what we are."" And Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators."" ""YAHOO,"" said Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot Com. Abraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic Educated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to locate things around the countryside. It soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating Everything (GOOGLE). That is how it all began. And that's the truth.",human,51u9bv,35,1473376556,0,2559,2559,469,4.456289978678038,24

Overnight, it became the hottest new place in town. It seemed like everyone was turned away at the door for not meeting dress code.

The man heads inside and the club is pitch black, except for candles under mirrors on the wall. There are some people dancing, but no music. Eventually, feeling around in the dark, he finds a railing and some stairs. He follows them down to a basement office, with a dimly lit sign overhead that reads ""The Abyss"" in which sits Friedrich Nietzsche. ""What the hell is going on? I fought your bouncer to get in, the club is all dark except for candles under mirrors and there are people dancing without music up there."" Nietzsche sat up in his chair and smiled, only really paying attention at the end of the man's rant. ""Monsters, is that you? It's a bit dark in here."" ""No, I'm Jeff. I'm here for a night out."" ""Ah yes, well then you should be more careful when you fight Monsters, lest you become one. I couldn't tell in the dim with you wearing his clothes."" ""What about the dancing upstairs?

They start talking about the gold theme and asking the bartender if parts of their memory are right.\n\n\nFirst guy: I remember, a beer with gold in it. But that seems, wrong...\n\nBartender: No, that's our golden pilsner, goldschlaeger and a light pilsner.\n\nSecond guy: Wow, okay, but you didn't actually have a golden waitress did you?\n\nBartender: Oh yeah, that's Janet, it's really just a lot of boddy glitter. \n\nThird guy: Yeah, all that seems pretty obvious. But, how'd you get a golden urinal?\n\nBartender yells to the musicians: Hey, Joe, I think I know who pissed in your saxophone last night.",ai,ai_2910,0,0,1,857,857,147,4.829931972789115,10

"So a man is at a bar...

So there was a guy at a bar drinking and minding his own business. Suddenly, a man walks in carrying a very large duffel bag. He sits down at the bar, and places his bag on the counter. **POOF!** Out popped a little man from the bag who looked around, and then jumped back in the bag.

"Franz was reading his book on death row...

It was the ‘storm of the century’. On death row, Franz was reading his religious texts, looking for God, even as the inmates of the neighbouring cells were having an explosive argument about who should get to shower first. ’14 days to execution’, Franz thought, as he physically and mentally trembled. If there were ever a time for divine interference, it was now. That was when everything went dark.\n\n‘This must be a power shortage,’ Franz mused to himself. ‘Wait, the backup generators obviously aren’t working either, or maybe just not yet. Maybe the electric doors are unlocked?’ Optimistically, Franz pushed on his cell door, which did give way!\n\nAdrenaline now coursing through his veins, Franz realised that this was it. He got to his feet and ran through multiple corridors, none of which had working doors. Then, he spotted a lone guard running up the corridor, obviously out of breath. With a quick punch and jab, the guard was down on the floor, and Franz snapped his neck with the adroitness of a practiced fighter and killer, which he was after all. The commotion in the rest of the prison, added to the noise of the rain, covered the noise generated by the quick melee.\n\nSearching through the guard’s possessions, Franz was delighted to find not only a wallet, but car keys! After quickly donning the guard’s gear, he ran towards the exit of the prison unstopped by anyone, and drove to his freedom. 300 miles away and in a small town of different state, Franz finally stopped to get what he needed after abandoning the car in the deep woods and taking along a bag-pack. ‘They’ll never find me now,’ he reasoned. It was then that he saw an extremely elegant lady with flaxen hair, walking down the street.\n\nFranz was tall, dark, handsome, and extremely charismatic. Knowing his strengths, he approached the lady, posing as a bag-packer. Over a short but sweet conversation, he convinced the lady, Elise, to let him stay the night at her place. Once the television came on in the morning though, bearing Franz’s mugshot and a ‘shoot on sight’ recommendation, it quickly dawned on Elise that she was harbouring an Eastern-European gangster who was also a wanted serial killer.\n\n‘NO WAY!’ Elise shouted at Franz, as Franz begged her to give him a chance. Ordinarily this would have just meant one more dead body. But over the night, Franz realised that he really loved Elise. Besides, from a pragmatic point of view a dead body popping up in this town would be of no help to himself, especially when the police search was centred 300 miles away.\n\nUsing every last drop of his linguistic virtuosity, Franz told Elise the very sad story of a child in a family of gangsters, who was born solely to be a mere pawn in the web of crime lynchpins. He managed to convince Elise to harbour him for just a few days. Those few days turned into weeks, then months, and eventually years.\n\nUsing a stolen identity, Franz and Elise were able to build a new life together, and enjoy everything that normal couples would. They toured the alpine paradises of Switzerland, and the caverns of Sonora. They enjoyed Italian operas, and American soaps. They engaged in extreme sports, and watched spectator games. But the one thing they shared a particular partiality for was comedy, in all its forms.\n\nAfter 13 years of sheer unadulterated bliss though, Elise was hit by the sudden discovery that she had late stage cancer, and only a few months to live. The first few days after the revelation were marked with intense anguish and bitterness for the couple. But as they slowly accepted Elise’s cruel fate, the couple were able to push forward and live their lives to the fullest, despite the impending tragedy. Gradually though, Elise’s energy waned, and the couple went from spending their time out rappelling and rock climbing, to spending never-ending nights in the ICU.\n\nOne night, as she was coughing up blood, Elise whispered laboriously to Franz, ‘I think this is it. I don’t think I’ll get past tonight. Can you get him to come?’\n\nFranz fumbled for his mobile phone and made a quick phone call. Over the last few months, Franz had managed to get a famous comedian to promise to do a stand-up routine for just himself and Elise, and he was now redeeming the promise he had extracted. After all, humour was the one thing that he shared with Elise most profoundly, and both of them wanted to spend their last day together, enjoying what they loved most.\n\nA mere 5 minutes later, there was a knock on the hospital door. A surprised Franz opened the door, and found himself staring at an entire SWAT team and down the barrels of their guns. In that moment, he knew the game was up. Instantly he fully felt the delayed tiredness of all the last few months.\n\n‘Is it him?’ Elise mumbled from her bed quite hoarsely and inaudibly. And as the last 14 beautiful years flashed in his head, Franz tiredly replied:\n\n&gt;!It's not the joke. It's the execution.!&lt;",ai,ai_1005,0,0,1,5018,5018,862,4.821345707656612,50

"Everyone needs a little relaxation time once in a while [Long]

So my friend and I decided to unwind and visit this Day Spa that she highly recommended.\n\nI had never heard of it before and asked her what was so great about it. However she refused to tell me why it was so good.\n\nSo we scheduled a visit for the following Sunday and when we arrived I realised why I’d never heard of it before. It was literally named ‘Day Spa’\n\nWhen we arrived we were greeted by this pretty looking receptionist who checked us in and directed us to a dressing room to get changed into the spa provided dressing gowns.\n\nWe left our things in a nearby locker and walked deeper into the spa. At this point my friend has this huge grin on her face and finally decides to tell me why this place is so good.\n\nShe explains that there are 26 different rooms of treatment each labelled A-Z and each specialising in different treatments from foot rubs to full body massages to hot stones.\n\nSo we agreed to split up and meet back up in 2 hours.\n\nThe first room I go into is room A. It’s quiet, and the only thing in the room is a single seat with an A engraved on it as well as a curtain. \n\nSo I sit down and almost instantly this beautiful woman pops out from behind the curtain and starts placing various hot towels on different parts of my body.\n\n15 mins later she takes them away and I get off of the seat, thoroughly relaxed and a lot less tense.\n\nNext I go into room F and, just like in room A there sits a single seat with the letter F engraved on it.\n\nI take a seat and hear a clanking sound beneath me. Before I can wonder what it is, the floor suddenly sinks into a circular hole.\n\nI was quite startled, that is until the hole started filling with warm water and the air was filled with a sweet, thick aroma.\n\n‘Herbal bath’ I realised. ‘Not bad’\n\nAnother 30 minutes pass and I decide I want to try something else, so I go to stand up but at that moment the floor starts to rise again and the water sinks back into the floor. ‘Neat’ I think to myself.\n\nI try a few other rooms and they’re all pretty similar at first glance with the seats being engraved with whatever room number they were in.\n\nThat is until is get to room O, where I see a big line has formed with people waiting excitedly at the door. \n\nI spot my friend at the end of the line and ask her why everyone’s so eager to get into this room.\n\nShe tells me that this is the best room in the entire day spa and that people sometimes book months in advance to reserve the seat.\n\nAfter 30 minutes or so of queueing, it’s my friend’s turn, 5 minutes later she comes out with the most relaxed and calm look on her face. \n\nI ask her what happened but she just winks at me and said I’ll “find out”\n\nI walk into the room and excitedly sit myself on seat O.\n\nSuddenly, a team of masseuses walk out from behind the curtain and begin to massage all over my body. They use hot wax, stones, towels, and every type of lotion and ointment I can recognise, and many I can’t. The music is also stunning, with angelic choirs and lustrous saxophones playing softly in the back ground\n\n5 minutes later I meet my friend outside and we leave the day spa, feeling utterly calm and relaxed.\n\nAbout a week later, some other friends of mine are discussing ways they like to relax. One of them says that music helps her unwind, another says she uses walks through the forest.\n\nThey turn to me and ask what I use to relax.\n\nI reply:\n\nDay Spa, Seat O.",ai,ai_3742,0,0,1,3519,3519,651,4.405529953917051,33

'Well, then it's our lead, that narcissistic fuck was so busy showing off in front of his fangirls that he forgot the lyrics.' 'Dude, that was the only verse when they actually cheered.'

"When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard.

A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate. When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards."" He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth..."" Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about.

Looking around, he saw a monastery sitting on a hill. He decided to ask to stay the night. The monks were welcoming and gave him a room to stay in.

"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.

His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n\nSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n\nAnd on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...\n\nAnd the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n\nAnd on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n\nSuddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.\n\nThe townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.\n\nThe mayor approached the lead monk of the order. \""What happened?\"" he asked, exasperated.\n\nThe old monk shook his head sadly. \""Isn't it obvious?\"" he said. \""Sam sung Note 7.\""",ai,ai_2228,0,0,1,2504,2504,430,4.823255813953488,34

...so they decided to start a flower shop in the name of the Lord. Now, these guys were the men of God, so all the people in the village wanted to buy from them, rather than the existing flower shop, which was not affiliated with the church. The owner of the existing flower shop felt this was entirely unfair, as he was there first, and they were stealing all of his customers to a market that he had the corner on. So he went over to the friars' shop and kindly asked them to take their business elsewhere or find some other way of making money. The friars laughed in his face, proclaiming how the greatness of the Lord had brought them into wealth. So he went home despondent and unsure of what to do. Then, he had the idea that maybe his wife could talk some sense into them. They ignored her requests as well. At this rate, he would be run out of business by the end of the month, so he went over and begged the friars to stop, saying he would even pay regular donations to church if they did so. Again, the friars remained steadfast, and ignored his wishes once more. As the final straw, the flower shop owner hired the toughest man in town, Hugh McTaggart, to go rough them up a little bit. Hugh did so, saying that if they didn't shut down he would destroy everything they owned. Fearless, and faithful that the righteousness of God would protect them from these heathens, the friars ignored Hugh as well. So the next day, Hugh came back to the friars' shop, took a giant hammer, and started smashing everything in the shop. The friars found they didn't have the funds to replace everything that was destroyed, so they finally decided to give in and close up their flower shop, proving that (are you ready?)

"Once upon a time...

A horse lived on a farm with a pig, a sheep, and a cow. Now these were no ordinary barnyard animals - for they were bestowed the miracle of Disney animal anthropomorphism - subsequently, the farmer was very happy to have these animals in his posession and the people who came afar to see them made him a very wealthy man. One day, the farmer's child leaves his guitar outside as his mother calls him for dinner. Curiously, the gang of animals approaches the instrument. The pig picks it up and strums tentatively trying to mimic what he saw the boy doing. He finds that he is a natural and when the farmer hears - he instantly sees the business potential. So the very next day, the farmer buys a drum-set, bass and another guitar and hands one to each of the animals. The horse himself took a liking to guitar whilst the sheep took the drums, leaving the cow on bass guitar. By sheer narrative convenience, all the animals showed prodigious skill at their respective instruments and became proficient players very quickly. The horse, with his gravelly melancholic voice assumed the role of vocalist. Their first gig was a roaring success and set them on the road for superstardom. It turned out that the saturated music market had a niche for a band of rock playing animals. Within weeks, they had released their first album and planned on doing a world tour. Tickets at every destination sell out almost instantly. The first half of their tour was uneventful, however, the horse - not used to the pressures of being a celebrity- began to use alcohol as escapism. He told himself he was in control but the other bandmembers noticed his problem and grew increasingly worried for the horse. One fateful night, the tourbus loses control on the tarmac and slips off the road into a sharp valley - everybody is killed but the horse. He stumbles out of the wreckage and begins searching for his friends and every corpse he stumbles across breaks him even more. The funeral was a dull affair and despite their stardom, few people turned up. The horse wept bitterly for his friends who he thought deserved a better farewell. Turning and leaving the procession, he wanders aimlessly into the city. Day quickly turns into night and a storm approaches. The horse hears the thunder in the distance, but he keeps walking like a man without cause. As the first drop begin to fall, the horse spies the neon lights of a bar which promise a warm refuge away from the rain and more importantly, his grief. So, the horse walks into the bar and the bartender asks, ""Why the long face?""",human,6iwa54,250,1498163613,0,2586,2586,461,4.609544468546638,26

As a guitarist, I play many gigs. Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost. I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play. The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man. And as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full. As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.” Apparently, I’m still lost…",human,4son8h,18,1468434281,0,1257,1257,247,4.089068825910931,18

"The Mexican president has a rare cancer of the brain and is in need of a brain transplant. His only option is a risky new procedure that his doctor recently perfected.

He now has to “shop” for his brain. “Sir, as this is a new procedure, our pool of brains you can choose from is rather small. Prices of the brains will vary,” said the doctor. “Okay, show me what you’ve got. I have an important job, so I’ll need the best brain,” replies the president. “A South Korean brain will cost you $80,000.” The Mexican president widens his eyes in shock at the price. But then thinks that yes, the Koreans are smart people. It is quite understandable that a brain from there would be costly. “A brain from China would cost $15.000,” the doc continued, “an American one would cost $2,500, and las-“ “HAH!” The president interrupted. “And those dumb Americans are always looking down on us. Look at their cheap ass brains!” The Mexican president smirks to himself. “As I was saying,” continued the doctor, “ lastly, a Mexican brain would cost $150,000.” Immediately, the president’s chest swells with pride, thinking what great minds his country has. “I’ll take the Mexican brain!” He exclaims, almost with a tear in his eye. After the operation, when the president is recovering, he begins to wonder and asks how the brains were priced. “Ah, you see, China has no shortage of brains from people getting terminated for unknown reasons. However, censorship and propaganda limits and degrades the brain somewhat. Hence the lower price. The Americans gorge their minds on social media, low quality entertainment and useless things like conspiracy theories. This combination really harms their brains, and the nonsense their president spouts also exacerbates this,” the doc adds with a slight smile. “What about Mexican brains? They’re the most expensive and therefore the best, right?” “Yes. They are the freshest minds with the most potential because most of them have never been used and are good as new.”",human,aon334,14,1549672274,0,1996,1996,338,4.905325443786983,27

"When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple days later, the town drunk...

...was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. \n\nThe priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate. When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, \""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.\"" \n\nHe listened a while longer, and said, \""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too.

"LOL : No love from Apple

Here is the back story , I have an app called ""Quotes for Instagram"" that does one thing and only one thing, it displays picture quotes and allows the user to share directly to Instagram and only Instagram. To share to Instagram the user would need to have the Instagram app installed . It was rejected by Apple , here is our funny thread going back and forth in the message center. --------------- September 23, 2015 at 12:39 PM From Apple 2.2 Details We discovered one or more bugs in your app when reviewed on iPhone running iOS 9 on both Wi-Fi and cellular networks. Specifically, no action takes place when we tapped the Share button on each picture. Next Steps Please run your app on a device to identify the issue(s), then revise and resubmit your app for review. --------------- September 23, 2015 at 12:50 PM Me : The device requires that the user have Instragram installed on their device, If Instagram is not installed on the device then they can not share to instagram . Is Instagram installed on your test devices? Their should be prompt that appears detailing this , I will double check , but in the meanwhile I hope this helps to track down the issue. --------------- September 23, 2015 at 2:20 PM From Apple Hello, Thank you for providing this information. Upon further review, we found your app to be in violation of the following guideline: 10.6 Details We were required to install Instagram before we could use your app. Apps should be able to run on launch, without requiring additional applications to be installed. Next Steps Please revise your app so that a user can use it upon launch. If your app requires authentication before use, please use methods that can authenticate users from within your app. We look forward to reviewing your revised app. Best regards, App Store Review ---------------- September 23, 2015 at 3:52 PM Me : LOL Technically you can still use the app (just not the share to IG part), I presume users would be clever enough to know that they should probably have Instagram installed to share to Instagram no? Re: Please revise your app so that a user can use it upon launch. If your app requires authentication before use, please use methods that can authenticate users from within your app. Authentication can only take place if the user has Instagram installed . If a user has the Instagram app installed but is not authenticated then upon clicking the sharing button they would be redirected to the Instagram in-app login screen where they would login and then be able to share their newly found quote. ---------------- September 23, 2015 at 6:45 PM From Apple 2.2 - Apps that exhibit bugs will be rejected Hello, Thank you for your response. For your app to become compliant with guideline 10.6 it would be appropriate to update the app to not require the Instagram app. We look forward to reviewing your revised app. Best regards, App Store Review ---------------- September 23, 2015 at 8:00 PM Me: Lol, This thread is very humorous, an app that shares to Instagram that does not require Instagram , I see the Gods are against us.

A young man named John received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary.

The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even more rude. John, in desperation, threw up his hand, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer.\n\nFor a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute. Fearing that he’d hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John’s outstretched arms and said “I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I’m sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.”\n\nJohn was stunned at the change in the bird’s attitude.

"When my grandfather was a young boy living outside a small town in rural Kentucky

they didn't have much as way of entertainment except for fishing and hunting with his big shaggy dog, Bear. When he wasn't helping his parents out with chores, he spent most of his summers out in the forests camping with Bear, hunting squirrels and rabbits, or just fishing along the river. He'd wandered a bit further away one day than he normally did, and came across an old monastary with a congregation of friars. Now, this region of Kentucky wasn't very well off, so what a lot of the small town farmers did was take their goods in to the larger city to sell at farmers markets and to stores. The friars were no exception to this because while they didn't need much money, they did need some to buy food and clothes. When my grandfather came across that old monastary, he'd seen acre after acre of wide open meadows just full of wildflowers of every sort you could imagine. Big yellow flowers, little red and blue speckled flowers, daisies, queen's lace. The fields were alive with bees buzzing and humming birds humming, truly, it was a beautiful, inspiring sight. And out there, scattered throughout the meadows, the friars, each with a big woven basket filled to the brim with boquets they crafted by hand. These were what they would send in to town to be sold. My great grandfather, that is, my grandpa's dad, worked for a man that lived in the city most of the local farmers would travel to to sell their produce. This man was a baron of sorts; he owned several businesses in town and he was always on the look out for a new business or property to invest in to grow his wealth. His name was Hugh, and he wasnt known for his huge, friendly demeanor. What he was known for was his ruthless and cunning sense of busines. Hugh never let anything get in his way when it came to growing his business. A year after my grandpa and Bear met the friars, a reporter came to town to photograph the festival they had every summer in town. This festival was the town's yearly highlight, at least as big a deal as Thanksgiving and nearly as big a deal as Easter and Christmas (which in those days made it a Very Big Deal indeed)! Every year for the festival the friars would supply the most stunning flower arrangements for the town's main street, through which the town would have a small parade with the mayor tossing candies for all the children, and men and women in costumes dancing along to music played by the school's small band. Folk from all around the town would journey in for the day, set up food stalls to sell pies and hot cakes, roast rabbit on toast and spicy squirrel stew. This year the festival was held in even higher anticipation because of the participation of the local fire department. They'd offered to lead the parade with a big red firetruck, and the firemen all dressed up in celebration. The fire department's presence was as much for the celebration as it was for safety. The previous year an unfortunate accident had caused a large fire to catch and spread to the forest around the town. Several blocks of the town had been evacuated before the fire was finally contained and put out, but not before some acres of the forest had burned down. But that event had gotten my grandpa's small town on the radar of the big city, and the local paper had decided to feature them in an article this particular summer! The festival was a tremendous success! The food was fantastic, the parade was picturesque! The friars flower displays were the highlight of the night, and the photographer made sure to do them as much justice as he could. Truly, they were the talk of the festival, to the point that some weeks later at the next farmers market in the city, the friars sold out of their boquets in the first hour of the morning! Word had spread, pardon the pun, like a fire, and everyone wanted to buy the friars flowers! Even old Hugh had seen and heard word of the sudden popularity of these boquets and went down to the market to see for himself. He stood, mouth agape, as a crowed massed around the floral displays, pushing to be the next to buy before the flowers were all gone. Much to the dismay of the friars, their newfound popularity lead to incredible new demand. And though they did try to prepare more boquets for the market, they were realy selling more than they'd ever intended. For while the did it for a little money to afford necessiries, for the friars, spreading beauty and peace with their flowers was more than enough in return. When Hugh saw the potential in the popularity of the flowers the friars grew, his mind immediately started working on a way to turn it to his benefit. He waited for the crowds to finally die down and went to speak to the holy men. ""I'd like to make you an offer,"" Hugh said. ""Your beautiful flowers are the talk of the town. I'd like to help you out by handling all the sales of the flowers for you, for a small cut of the profit! That way, you can focus on growing and creating your wonderful boquets, without worrying about the hassle and bother of coming into the market each week and dealing with the crowds!"" The friars thanked Hugh for his offer, but they explained to him that for them, the boquets were not just a business endeavor, it was their service to the community to spread peace and joy with God's flowers and blessings. And with that, the friars packed up and started the journey back to their monastary. Well, Hugh was not satisfied at all with that answer, and he came up with a plan. Over the next few weeks he ordered crate after craft of exotic flowers from all around the world. Beautiful flowers from Morocco to France, stunning petals from China to India. Anything colorful and amazing that he could learn about. He set up a large shop just down the road from the Farmer's market where the Friars had their stall, and he called it The Festival Flourist and Fantastic Flowers. At first, the town was abuzz with these new and wonderful flowers, but after a few weeks, as the novelty wore off, the sales declined and soon Hugh's shop was empty. For some reason he couldn't figure out, though, the friars were doing as well as ever! Week in and out, lines down the street would stand patiently waiting for the friars flowers. And cunning as he was, Hugh would not rest until he'd made his new business a success. A year or so later, my grandpa was on another fishing adventure with Bear, just following allong with stream, sometimes wading through the shallower parts of the water, othertimes dropping in a line and resting in the shade of a tree, when he saw thick, black smoke rising above the forest. Curious as any young boy would be, he set off at a run through the trees, heading towards the smoke. When he reached a large open meadow, a devastating sight lay before him: dozens of friars with brooms and small buckets were frantically working through the flower meadows tyring their best to fight thick, hot flames that were scorching along the ground! Some how, all the flower meadows had caught fire, and try as they might, nothing the friars could do was stopping the flames. The fire department was evnetually contacted and they made it out to the monastary before too much of the forest had burned down, but sadly all of the flowers in the meadows had been left a charred, ruined mess. For the first time in years, the friars had no flowers to for the town's festival. Full of dismay, they sent word to the mayor that there was nothing they could do to salvage the flower displays for that year's parade, and whispers grew with worry that the festival that year might not live up to the town's hopes. It was then that, just by hapenstance, Hugh visited town to meet with the mayor about opening a new business there in town. When he heard about the problems with the fire and the flowers, of course he'd be delighted to supply the town with all the flowers they could need, for a small fee. In the end, I'm afraid that there's no truly happy ending here: the Mayor accepted Hugh's flowers and his flower shop's popularity grew from then on. But the moral of the story is this, my friends: Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.",human,cpsh8k,5,1565699469,0,8223,8223,1500,4.482,53

I'm Satan. If there's *anything* I can do for you to make your stay comfortable, let me know.\""\n\nStill stunned, the guy nods and continues to sit while Satan goes off to talk to others.

Is there anything I can get for you? Champagne? Cocaine?\""\n\nThe guy shakes his head and says, \""Uh, no, thanks, but I was wondering... what's with all the people out in the fire?

A woman is pregnant in her teens...finally gives birth to two healthy twin boys. She’s young, and destitute, and knows she can’t take care of them or provide for them, and after a bit of soul searching she makes the heartbreaking decision to give the two boys up for adoption. Over the years she kept track of the twins; one was adopted by a well-to-do family in Dubai. They named him Amahl; they own an exporting conglomerate and her son would never want for anything, and was given the best education a man could ever need, and access to resources that she could never dream of. The other twin was adopted by a family in Mexico who name him Juan. The family owns a lot of land and runs a huge produce operation that ships their products all around the globe. As wrenching as that heartbreaking decision was years ago, she was relieved to know that her boys grew up to be healthy young men with all the life opportunities in front of them that she could in no way have provided. They’re living beautiful lives, and that thought provided her with some some small consolation over the years.\n\nFast forward 25 years later. The young girl is now a happily married woman... but there hasn’t been a day since she gave those boys up for adoption that she hasn’t thought of them.\nAnd one day, she receives a letter from Juan. He had tracked her down and sent her a letter, and he included a recent picture of himself. He wrote that some day maybe he would try to visit. And she cried and cried and cried. She told her husband the story of the beautiful twin boys that she had given birth to such a long time ago; the story that she had hidden from him for all that time...the shame she felt, and the years of longing that only a heartbroken mother could know, or endure. She cried at how Juan had become such a handsome young man and how she wanted to see her other son to which her husband replied; “Honey, There’s no reason to; if you’ve seen Juan, you’ve seen Amahl\"".",ai,ai_7649,0,0,1,1997,1997,370,4.397297297297297,20

"There was this musician in North Korea....

One day he was called upon by Kim Jong Un to compose a piece of music and have the Great North Korean Orchestra play it live to him in the Humble Auditorium. The musician, not wanting to displease the Great Leader, did as he asked and got to work composing a piece of music. One week later, on the night of the performance, the musician accepted the applause and stood in front of the orchestra. He breathed in gently, smiled and looked around and prompted the musicians to begin playing. They were AWFUL! They didn't play the music like it had been written, they were out of sync, out of tune, the strings were ahead of the wind instruments, the drummer seemed to have a mind of his own and the audience winced in pain. Embarassed that he had told his dinner guests about the brilliance of North Korean musicians only to be greeted by this performance, Kim Jong Un immediately ordered the musician to be executed. The guards came, and offered the musician a last meal before his execution. ""I'll have a hot curry,"" said the musician. When it arrived he ate it slowly and carefully - it was the hottest curry he had in a while, and then he sat in the electric chair to await his fate. The guards flipped the switch and smoked filled the room with sparks flying everywhere - but nothing happened - the musician was unharmed. Impressed by the man surviving his ordeal, Kim Jong Un decided to give the musician another chance to impress him. The man thanked the Great Leader and got straight to work writing another piece of music. ""This is it!"" the musician thought as he finished crafting what was the most brilliant piece of music he had ever created. The big night came and again he stood in front of the orchestra. He smiled, nodded and the orchestra began. It was WORSE than the first time. The brass sounded like shrieking cats, the wind instruments sounded like howling wind in a thunderstorm and the pace was too fast. Angry that he had been embarrassed once again - the Great Leader called for execution. Again, the man asked for curry for his last meal. ""This time I'd like extra chilli,"" he said. So he ate his curry and sat in the electric chair. Again - sparks flew, smoke filled the room - but nothing happened. The man was unharmed. Amazed that he was still alive, the Great Leader gave him a final chance. ""This had better be your best music ever!"" he warned the musician. Humbly the musician thanked him, bowed graciously and left to compose his next piece. For weeks on end he laboured, changing notes, trying new variations, experimented with previously unheard variations to minor keys - until one day he had cracked it. ""This is my masterpiece!"" he cried. The night of the performance came - and again the man stood in front of the orchestra, looked around at them with the expression of a man who was sure nothing could go wrong and they began. It was a COMPLETE DISASTER! They sounded even worse than the first two times. The audience left the Auditorium shrieking and covering their ears. Nothing in the history of humanity had ever sounded that awful. ""That's it!"" bellowed the Great Leader - ""Let's take you to be executed straight away. No curry, no last meal. This madness must be stopped!"" he exclaimed. They took the musician away, strapped him into the electric chair, turned the voltage up to the maximum and waited. This time, the sparks filled the room, a small fire started at the base of the chair, the smoke was dark and heavy and the musician started twitching in the chair. ""Finally,"" thought the great leader, ""that should do it."" But when the smoke cleared, the man was still alive smiling. ""But we didn't give you any chili,"" said Kim Jong Un. ""Oh, it had nothing to do with the chilli,"" the man said, ""I'm just a terrible conductor.""",human,6jd9z7,28,1498378142,0,3818,3818,688,4.549418604651163,43

"A town has banned music, and a monastery has popped up dedicated to worship in chorus.

The town's police were at the gates of the monastery every night, however the brother of the town's mayor was part of the monks, and used his connection to his brother to stop the police from interrupting their choral ceremonies.\n\nAfter a year long stalemate, a man named Hugh came to the town, and decided to run for mayor. The race was close, but the townspeople were tired of listening to the monks chorus in the late nights, and decided that their current mayor would not stop them.\n\nThe same day he won, Hugh had demanded the monks cease singing, or else he would have to take extreme measures. Finally the monk's chorus stopped, and with it the monastery planned to migrate to a new town.\n\nAwestruck, a police officer that was transferred from a different town's department went to the chief and asked him a question. \""How is it after a year of arguments, the prior mayor didn't stop the monks' songs, yet this mayor stopped it in a day.\""\n\nThe police chief smiled at the new recruit as he said \""Don't you know?

The young lady threw aside her whip, flung back her cape and sat on the chair as naked as the day she was born.

It's an open mic night so all kinds of people with different instruments want to get up and jam. When the song is over Octodad stands up on the chair and proclaims, ""My name is Octodad and this here is my pet octopus and he can play any instrument at all!"" People guffaw. Pfft, yea right buddy, get lost. ""I'm serious!"" He shouts. ""His name is Octobud and I'll bet anyone in here $50 he can play any instrument you put in front of him!"" The crowd giggles and stirs as expected for a couple of minutes while the mood kind of settles until the trumpet player, just walking off stage says, ""All right man. Let's see what your little buddy can do!"" Octobud picks up the trumpet, wipes off the mouthpiece (because ew jazz players), and begins to trumpet out a medley so soothing and soft one girl even starts crying. People are shocked when the song is over. Jaw dropped staring at an octopus on a bar. Octodad takes the $50 off the table. ""Any others want to try and stump my little friend here?"" And the crowd piles forward cheering and reaching for their money and any weird instruments they brought with them. People are running out the door to run home and get instruments like that weird thing with strings Aunt Bertha brought back from Uganda that one time.... A trombone was next. Dude thought OG'Puss couldn't reach(dabbingoctopus.jpg). Wrong. Cello player thinking Octobud couldn't use his suckers on a neck. Wrong. The house drummer actually tried. Like c'mon man it's a frigging octopus, of course he nails the drums. Gloriously. Now while all this was going on it was a peaceful night outside. Old Angus Mc'Cloud saw the octopus come in and heard Octodad sing his little buddies praises. That brought on a smirk when he heard that. ...off to home he went... On Angus's way back into the bar with a sack under his arm, little Octobud was really starting to draw a crowd! People were still cramming into the place to watch that little slimy dude play some crazy lick's man! Upon entering there was a cacophony of maracas and tambourines, and somehow a cymbal from the ceiling fan, being played by Octobud who is now on stage and people are cheering him on. Good\_times.woodcut So when the song is over Angus takes his bag from under his arm and heads for the stage. ""Ay ye wee cunt. Ae wanna see ya trinnea play a diddly on this little doozy."" \*record scratch\* Nobody has seen bagpipes in that bar since that time in 1994 when those tourists got lost on the way to that wedding Carl was supposed to cater for... The crowd is hushed. Octobud is inspecting the bagpipes, tilting his head left and right, blinking a little too hard maybe... Octodad leans over and kind of whispers, ""Hey bud, c'mon. You can play this right?"" To which Octobud replies, ""Play it?! As soon as I figure out how to get its pajama's off I'm going to fuck it!!""",human,c0fa05,11,1560483024,0,3320,3320,605,4.487603305785124,42

"The nasty parrot

A young man named John received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird’s mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity. John tried and tried to change the bird’s attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to ‘clean up’ the bird’s vocabulary. Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even more rude. John, in desperation, threw up his hand, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer. For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute. Fearing that he’d hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer.

"A nun in a pub

A nun, really needing to go to the bathroom, walked into a neighborhood pub. The place was hopping with music and dancing but every once in a while the lights would turn off. Each time after the lights would go out the place would erupt into cheers. However, when the revelers saw the nun, the room went dead silent. She walked up to the bartender, and asked,\"" May I please use the restroom?\""\n\nThe bartender replied, \""I really don't think you should.\""\n\n\""Why not? \"" the nun asked.\n\n\""Well, there is a statue of a naked man in there, and his most private part is covered only by a fig leaf. \""\n\n\""Nonsense,\"" said the nun, \""I'll just look the other way.\""\n\nSo the bartender showed the nun the door at the top of the stairs, and she proceeded to the restroom. After a few minutes, she came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and dancing again. However, they did stop just long enough to give the nun a loud round of applause.\n\nShe went to the bartender and said, \""Sir, I don't understand. Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom?\""\n\n\""Well, now they know you're one of us,\"" said the bartender. \""Would you like a drink?\""\n\n\""But, I still don't understand,\"" said the puzzled nun.\n\n\""You see,\"" laughed the bartender, \""every time the fig leaf is lifted on the statue, the lights go out in the whole place.

when I went to Wal-Mart. Since I retired, trips to Wally World to look at the 'Wal-Martians' is always good for some comic relief. While standing in line to check out, the guy in front of me, probably in his early thirties, asked, ""Are you a Vietnam Vet?"" ""No,"" I replied. ""Then why are you wearing that cap?"" ""Because I couldn't find the one from the War of 1812."" [I thought this was a snappy retort.] ""The War of 1812, huh?"" the 'Wal-Martian' queried, ""When was that?"" God forgive me, but I couldn't pass up such an opportunity. ""1936,"" I answered, as straight-faced as possible. He pondered my response for a moment, and then asked, ""Why do they call it the War of 1812 if it was in 1936?"" ""It was a Black Operation. No one is supposed to know about it."" (This was beginning to be way too much fun!) ""DUDE! Really?"" he exclaimed. ""How did you get to do something that COOL?"" I glanced furtively around me for effect, leaned toward the guy, and in a low voice, said. ""I'm not sure. I was the only Caucasian on the mission."" ""Dude!!"" he was really getting excited about what he was hearing! ""That is seriously awesome! But, didn't you... kind of stand out?"" ""Not really.

"Nevermind, being a musician sucks

I can’t believe I actually wanted to make it to this height. Kicking pop music’s ass and taking the throne. I tried so hard to sign to a major label, but nobody told me how stressful touring would be. I had to spend the whole year touring for my new breakout album at the time. It actually beat out Michael Jackson’s new album, so that’s cool. But honestly, why? He’s so much better than the shit that was on that album. It’s all just lazy garage pop tunes shat out by my ADHD-riddened ass. All it takes is one popular song for you to have fangirls eating at your ass. Half of my fan base doesn’t even know any songs outside of my most popular one, and I don’t even like the song. They play it on KEXP one hundred and fifteen times a day. I shit you not. It was so much better when they played November Rain, and I hate Guns ‘N Roses. Even with other songs outside of my most popular song, people who listen to songs outside of that one song still overrate my work and give no fair criticism. We got these elitists over here thinking they’re cool because they bought my first album which no one bought at the time, and these retards over here thinking my David Bowie cover at a live acoustic show was an original fucking song of mine. And don’t get me started on the celebrity drama shit. I’m married to a complete fucking bitch, but I still love her because she’s really the only one I will probably ever date. We have a daughter, but she’s such a shitty parent and recently we have accusations of injected our daughter with heroin because the media is full of assholes with no form of empathy whatsoever. I always get the fear that she’s cheating on me to. After all, she dated my weird jackass friend from Chicago who no one cares about(yet)before me. Perhaps she’s still fucking with him?

When he was done the manager said, “that was amazing, I’ve never even heard that, what’s it called?” He replied, “thank you, I wrote it myself. I named it Dirty Cunt Dripping” “Huh strange” he said to the man, “please, play one more song” So again, he plays an even more astounding song. To which the manager asked for the name. The man replies, “I’m glad you liked it, I named that one Hairy Asshole With Dingle Berries” The manager replied “Well I’ll tell you what, come back tomorrow night, but please wear something nice. I can’t have you in here wearing those dirty clothes. Also, please don’t tell people the names of your songs.” So the man, ecstatic, leaves and comes back the next day.

"Double Whammy

So about a year and a half ago, I started dating a girl who loved to hear me play guitar. Her name was Alice, and probably her favorite song I played was Barracuda, and she was really into 80s music and culture. I really liked this girl and wanted to get serious, so I decided I wanted to get her something special for Christmas. I don't own any music on vinyl, except I did have the album Bad Animals by Heart (who wrote Barracuda), so I decided to give it to her. Cue Christmas day, when I made time to go see her between family Christmas celebration so that I could give her the album as a present. I was so excited, but when she opened it, she looked a little underwhelmed. I guess I had amped up the present a little too much, because I could tell she didn't really like it. That night my dad got a vinyl record player, and so he asked me if I had my heart album we could listen to it, but since we didn't have it, the only other album we could find was by one of my least favorite bands, Tears for Fears. It was an all around horrible day. The next day, I found out that she had re-gifted it to her mom, and I was really upset. We got in a huge argument and eventually her mom felt bad enough that she gave me the album back. We mended things and are doing all around a whole lot better than last year. This Christmas season is already going a lot better, and have decided to try and gift the album again, but this time to my cousin who is a little mentally handicapped. She is really into Heart and would absolutely love the album, and it just kinda brings back bad memories for me. Plus, since she will be at my house this Christmas we can listen to it instead of that horrible Tears for Fears album. The only problem is that this year, Alice hinted that I should give her the album again (she has started to listen to Heart regularly and really enjoys their music now). She had been hinting but I had deflected and kinda changed the subject every time it was brought up until the other day when she told me straight up ""I would really like that album for Christmas this year. I'm sorry I gave it to my mom, that was wrong of me, but I would love to have it this year."" I was very frustrated, and replied, ""Last Christmas I gave you my Heart, but the very next day you gave it away. This year, to save me from Tears, I'll give it to someone special.""",human,5evx16,12,1480109411,0,2373,2373,467,4.081370449678801,21

"Three Sinful Men

It just so happened one particular day that three particular men died particularly sinful deaths.\n\nThe first was a cattle rancher from Montana who was shot in the back by a jealous husband as he tried to jump out a second story window. The second was a college student from California who overdosed on heroin. The third was a musician from Michigan who had killed himself after murdering his ex-wife.\n\nAs the final breaths left their lungs and the final spasms wracked their failing bodies the souls of these men were magically whisked away to the infernal plane to await their final judgment. Naked and chained the terrified sinners gazed about the hellish environs in abject confusion. Without warning a towering pillar of flame erupted before them, and as a blinding shower of sparks dissipated the quivering men could make out a demonic silhouette.\n\n\""Kneel before me cretins, for I am your new god!\"" screamed a voice equal parts unfathomable evil and undeniable seduction. The command was accompanied by the crackle of a vicious whip and the pungent scent of brimstone. The three men immediately prostrated themselves before the succubus and began to plead pitifully for leniency.\n\n\"" Silence you wretches!\"" was the heartless reply to their mewling. Amid the choked sobs and sniffles of the bewildered sinners a pointy toothed grin was taking shape on the mouth of the demonesse. As her wicked expression grew more intense the succubus began to laugh a shrill, haughty laugh which chilled her audience to the bone despite the oppressive heat of the fiery realm.\n\n\"" Very well, if it is reprieve you seek from your just punishments then I suggest a wager.\"" the succubus chided. The men lifted their heads and began exchanging wary yet hopeful glances. \""I strike this pact with you three, if I can grasp your manhoods for a count of three times three without thee screaming, falling or fleeing then may you enter the accursed realm of heaven!\""\n\nThe rancher was the first to respond, gathering what tattered shreds of his dignity remained he stood tall and said, \"" well, I reckon it's worth a shot lady.\""\n\nThe fires of eternal damnation gleamed behind the succubus's eyes as she sauntered towards the condemned man. As her clawed hand closed around his member, the ranchers eyes grew wide with pain. Smoke escaped from the demons grip as the man cried out in ultimate suffering. His Johnson having been reduced to cinders, he was cast down to hell in a stinking plume of fire and brimstone.\n\nThe college student was visibly shaken by this turn of events but steeled himself nonetheless. \""I guess I don't have anything to lose...\"" he muttered as the succubus gleefully encircled his penis with her smoldering talons. His screams began immediately as his family jewels became a puddle on the ground. He too was cast screaming into the darkness.\n\nThe third man was strangely calm, the beginnings of a wry smile dancing about the edges of his mouth. \""A'ight girl, let's see what you got.\"" he bravely challenged. \n\nIncensed by the man's temerity, the succubus seized upon his trouser snake with such force it seemed she might tear it off. Expecting to hear immediate howls of anguish the succubus became increasingly perplexed as her awkward tug of war dragged on without a sound. The seconds ticked by without incident until eventually the demon was forced to relent. She stared in awe as radiant white pinions began to sprout from the man's back. The faint sound of an angelic choir could be heard as a thunderous white light broke through the perpetual gloom of hell. The man's face pointed upwards as he began to ascend to heaven.\n\nFrustrated and confused the succubus could do nothing but watch her prize abscond beyond reach. As the redeemed murderer flew out of sight she screamed, \"" how?!\""\n\nAmid the delicate sounds of angel wings and a heavenly chorus the succubus heard a reply.\n\n\""I melt in your mouth, not in your hands bitch.\""",ai,ai_7048,0,0,1,3994,3994,665,5.006015037593985,39

A young man named John received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird’s mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity.

Not a peep was heard for over a minute. Fearing that he’d hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer.

She asks the doctor to keep the operation a secret as she is embarrassed and does not want anyone to find out. The doctor agrees. She wakes up from the operation and finds three roses carefully placed on her nightstand. Outraged, she immediately calls the doctor and says \"" I told you not to tell anyone!\"" The doctor replies, \""Don't worry, I didn't tell a soul!\"" When the woman inquires about the roses the doctor says, \""Oh, those! The first rose is from me. I felt bad because you went through this all by yourself. The second rose is from my nurse. She assisted me with your operation and has been through this procedure herself, so she understands what you're going through. And the third rose is from the guy upstairs in the burn unit. He wanted to thank you for his new ears.\""",ai,ai_6719,0,0,1,903,903,166,4.4397590361445785,11

"Big mistake

As a guitarist, I play many gigs. Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost. I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do so I started to play. The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man. As I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full. As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.” Apparently, I’m still lost...",human,7p0cim,13,1515434767,0,1257,1257,247,4.089068825910931,18

"When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard.

A couple of days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried.

Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.

He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backward, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

"DIVORCE

"Three Sinful Men

It just so happened one particular day that three particular men died particularly sinful deaths. The first was a cattle rancher from Montana who was shot in the back by a jealous husband as he tried to jump out a second story window. The second was a college student from California who overdosed on heroin. The third was a musician from Michigan who had killed himself after murdering his ex-wife. As the final breaths left their lungs and the final spasms wracked their failing bodies the souls of these men were magically whisked away to the infernal plane to await their final judgment. Naked and chained the terrified sinners gazed about the hellish environs in abject confusion. Without warning a towering pillar of flame erupted before them, and as a blinding shower of sparks dissipated the quivering men could make out a demonic silhouette. ""Kneel before me cretins, for I am your new god!"" screamed a voice equal parts unfathomable evil and undeniable seduction. The command was accompanied by the crackle of a vicious whip and the pungent scent of brimstone. The three men immediately prostrated themselves before the succubus and began to plead pitifully for leniency. "" Silence you wretches!"" was the heartless reply to their mewling. Amid the choked sobs and sniffles of the bewildered sinners a pointy toothed grin was taking shape on the mouth of the demonesse. As her wicked expression grew more intense the succubus began to laugh a shrill, haughty laugh which chilled her audience to the bone despite the oppressive heat of the fiery realm. "" Very well, if it is reprieve you seek from your just punishments then I suggest a wager."" the succubus chided. The men lifted their heads and began exchanging wary yet hopeful glances. ""I strike this pact with you three, if I can grasp your manhoods for a count of three times three without thee screaming, falling or fleeing then may you enter the accursed realm of heaven!"" The rancher was the first to respond, gathering what tattered shreds of his dignity remained he stood tall and said, "" well, I reckon it's worth a shot lady."" The fires of eternal damnation gleamed behind the succubus's eyes as she sauntered towards the condemned man. As her clawed hand closed around his member, the ranchers eyes grew wide with pain. Smoke escaped from the demons grip as the man cried out in ultimate suffering. His Johnson having been reduced to cinders, he was cast down to hell in a stinking plume of fire and brimstone. The college student was visibly shaken by this turn of events but steeled himself nonetheless. ""I guess I don't have anything to lose..."" he muttered as the succubus gleefully encircled his penis with her smoldering talons. His screams began immediately as his family jewels became a puddle on the ground. He too was cast screaming into the darkness. The third man was strangely calm, the beginnings of a wry smile dancing about the edges of his mouth. ""A'ight girl, let's see what you got."" he bravely challenged. Incensed by the man's temerity, the succubus seized upon his trouser snake with such force it seemed she might tear it off. Expecting to hear immediate howls of anguish the succubus became increasingly perplexed as her awkward tug of war dragged on without a sound. The seconds ticked by without incident until eventually the demon was forced to relent. She stared in awe as radiant white pinions began to sprout from the man's back. The faint sound of an angelic choir could be heard as a thunderous white light broke through the perpetual gloom of hell. The man's face pointed upwards as he began to ascend to heaven. Frustrated and confused the succubus could do nothing but watch her prize abscond beyond reach. As the redeemed murderer flew out of sight she screamed, "" how?!"" Amid the delicate sounds of angel wings and a heavenly chorus the succubus heard a reply. ""I melt in your mouth, not in your hands bitch.""",human,58h0wd,0,1476972553,0,3936,3936,677,4.813884785819793,39

"JOKES...as told by a German perspective

**THIS IS LONG BUT HAD TO SHARE HERE; HOPE YOU ALL APPRECIATE THIS AS MUCH AS I DO** GERMAN JOKES Knock, knock. Who's there? The police. I'm afraid there's been an accident. Your husband is in hospital. A man walks into a pub. He is an alcoholic whose drink problem is destroying his family. Did you hear about the blonde who jumped out off a bridge? She was clinically depressed and took her own life because of her terribly low self-esteem. What do you call a cat with no tail? A Manx cat. Why do undertakers wear ties? Because their profession is very serious, and it is important that their appearance has a degree of gravitas. How many electricians does it take to change a light bulb? One. How many engineers does it take to change a light bulb? None, it is far more efficient in both time and money to change it yourself. Failing that, ask a relative or neighbour to change it for you. Why do women fake orgasms? Because they want to give men the impression that they have climaxed. Two men are sitting in a pub. One man turns to the other and says: 'Last night I saw lots of strange men coming in and out of your wife's house.' The other man replies: 'Yes, she has become a prostitute to subsidise her drug habit.' Two cows are in a field. Suddenly, from behind a bush, a rabbit leaps out and runs away. One cow looks round a bit, eats some grass and then wanders off. Why are there no aspirin in the jungle? Because it would not be financially viable to attempt to sell pharmaceuticals in the largely unpopulated rainforest. What do you get when you cross a chicken with a centipede? A media circus about the debate over the morals and ethics of genetic engineering. So, there were an Irishman, an Englishman and an American wrecked on an island. One day, they found a bottle, and when they opened it, a ghost came out and offered them each a wish. However, even though they wished for different stuff, nothing happened, as the three guys of varying nationalities were just having shared hallucinations from hunger. How do you drown a blonde? Hold her head underwater until she can no longer breathe and stops struggling. Why did the blonde get fired from the M&M factory? Repeated absences and stealing.

The black man says, ""I just got back from a funeral"" What do you say to a woman with two black eyes? ""Would you like an ice pack?"" Why did the deaf man take his parrot to work? He was weird.

The next interviewee enters the office and the agent tells him the same thing he told the first guy. The second man takes the gun, walks into the room, and walks out. 'Sorry, I can't.' he says. The last man enters the office and the interviewer said yet again explains the test.' The man says ""I'm sorry I love my wife too much to do such a harmful thing, I guess the FBI is not for me after all."" What's sad about 4 black people in a Cadillac going over a cliff? They were my friends. Why did the chicken cross the road? Earlier that morning the farmers daughter had inadvertently left the gate to the yard open as she was preoccupied by her worry over a maths test set for that day. She hadn't studied for the test as she was still deeply distressed over her fathers recent heart attack. This, coupled with the added burden of household chores now delegated to her because her mother was out trying to get the west field prepared for sowing, had made her quite forgetful and distracted of late. Whilst several chickens escaped, only one strayed so far that it actually encountered the road facing the farm. After crossing the road and gorging itself in a soybean crop, the chicken was struck by a furniture removers van as it attempted to make its way home. Several hours later the dead chicken was spotted by a Community Mental Health Worker who was doing his bi-weekly rural clinic run. The chicken, being a bantam caught the eye of the Mental Health worker, who was a keen trout fisherman. ""Cool"" thought the mental health worker- ""those feathers will make for excellent trout flies"". He stopped and plucked a handful of the most iridescent blue, green and orange feathers and placed them in an envelope. He rolled himself a cigarette, sat on the trunk of his car and admired the clouds. ""God, I love this job"", he muttered to no one in particular. Satan takes the form of Jesus and appears to three priests saying that if they do something evil, he'll let them drink of the holy water. The three priests discuss the offer and come to the conclusion that Satan must be tricking them into committing sin. When confronted with this accusation, Satan reveals his dastardly plot and salutes the priests on their cunning and steadfast faith. Why couldn't Helen Keller drive? Because she was blind and deaf. Otto and Beata give birth to a young child. This is impossible, because a baby cannot be born as a young child, therefore the previous sentence is rendered void and should be corrected. I apologise on behalf of myself, and myself only, for this major yet forgivable mistake. The Pope walks into a bar. The bartender says, what'll ya have, Pope? But the Pope's grasp of English is tenuous at best, so he mumbles something in Latin. The bartender doesn't know any Latin. The Pope gets frustrated and leaves. Have you seen Stevie Wonder's new house? No. Well, it's really nice. Where did Hitler keep his armies? The brunt of his forces were applied to the Eastern front, but throughout different periods of the war, a sizable chunk were used to protect the Atlantic Wall and a handful of divisions were used in Africa, to secure shipping routes. A kid is riding down the street when his chain pops off his bicycle. The kid yells ""God damn!"" as he begins to fix it.

What's the difference between a Jew and a pizza? A Jew is a person adhering to the Jewish faith and a pizza is an oven-baked, flat, usually circular bread covered with tomato sauce and cheese with optional garnishes. What do you get when you turn 3 blondes upside-down? An embarrassing situation Why did the blonde tattoo her zip code on her stomach? She was a schizophrenic. How do you confuse a blonde? Paint yourself green and throw forks at her. What's the deal with airline peanuts? The packaging is generally poorly designed and cheaply made, as a method of cutting distribution costs. After all, most passengers wouldn't want a ""Peanut Fee"" attached to their already costly ticket prices in order to cover the expenses of higher quality wrappers. What are you complaining about, anyway? It's free food, and it's a nice snack. If you're really that bent on not enjoying the peanuts the airline so graciously provided you with, just save them and give them to the next homeless person you see. People these days are really selfish. How do you make a Swiss roll? Generally it involves a thin layer of sponge cake and a layer of either jam or cream. The resulting flat sheet of cake and cream is then rolled into a cylinder. It's quite delicious, actually. What's the difference between Michael Jackson and a shopping bag. One is a famous singer songwriter facing charges of child molestation and the other's a thin plastic sheet formed into a shape most fitting to carrying large amounts of shopping so that its easier to carry. How many mice does it take to screw in a lightbulb? I imagine it would take a great many. Mice would find it difficult to reach a ceiling light fitting, and would individually lack the strength or dexterity required to turn a bulb in such a socket. Even if you had enough mice to lend their strength to such an endeavor, the chances of them having the intelligence and wherewithal to perform such a complex activity is really quite low. A blonde girl walks into the local dry cleaners. She places a garment on the counter. ""I'll be back tomorrow afternoon to pick up my dress."" she says. ""Come again?"" says the clerk, cupping his ear. ""I said 'I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW AFTERNOON TO PICK UP MY DRESS',"" says the girl, this time louder. A man walks past a bar and sees a sign which says ""PERFORM THE THREE FEATS AND WIN A MILLION DOLLARS!"" Thinking that a million dollars sounds like a great idea, he goes inside and asks the bartender what the deal is. ""First,"" says the bartender, ""you have to chug this entire bottle of vodka. Second, there's a crocodile in the back room with a bad tooth. You have to pull it. Third, there's an eighty-five year old woman in the back who's never had sex. You have to have sex with her."" The guy think it over and says ""okay, sure. You have a deal!"" He grabs the bottle of vodka and, with little effort due to the fact that he's basically a professional alcoholic anyway, downs it. Then he slams the empty bottle down and goes into the back room. There's a lot of screaming, some growling, and various crashing sounds. Finally a silence falls upon the bar. Minutes pass, then an hour. Finally the bartender sends a barmaid back to see what's going on. A few minutes later, she comes back out. ""What's he doing?"" asks the bartender. ""What's left of him is back there in the croc pen,"" she says, her horrified face pale with shock. ""His clothes are tossed in the corner. I think he tried to fuck the croc. The croc...the croc ate him."" ""Oh, Jesus,"" whispers the bartender. ""Jesus."" Nobody says a word. A man has been trapped on a desert island for 8 years. One day, he sees a boat on the horizon and lights a fire to let it know he is there. The boat comes towards the shore. On board there is a beautiful woman in a body hugging wetsuit. ""Thank God"", he says, ""I've been trapped on this island for eight years. Thank god someone has come at last."" ""Eight years?"" she says, ""So it's eight years since you last smoked a Cuban cigar?"" She unzips a pocket on her wetsuit and pulls out a cigar. She passes it to him, pulls out a Zippo, and lights it for him. He enjoys the first cigar he has had in eight years. ""So is it also eight years since you had a drink?"" She unzips a pocket on her wetsuit and pulls out a hip flask, tossing it to him. He takes a swig, and it's 25 year old single malt whisky. It's smooth and mellow and utterly delicious. ""So,"" she says, beginning to unzip the long zipper on the front of her costume, ""Is it eight years since you played around?"" ""Oh no,"" he says, ""This is all a dream, isn't it? A beautiful woman with whiskey and cigars wanting to have sex with me? I must be dreaming."" Suddenly he is woken up by a flash of lightning. It's the middle of the night, and he is all alone in his primitive shelter on his desert island. So alone... so terribly alone. An Illinois man left the snowballed streets of Chicago for a vacation in Florida. His wife was on a business trip and was planning to meet him there the next day. When he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick e-mail. Unable to find the spool of paper on which he had written her e-mail address, he did his best to type it in from memory. Unfortunately, he missed one letter, and his note was directed instead to an elderly preacher's wife whose husband had passed away only the day before. When the grieving widow checked her e-mail, she took one look at the monitor, did not recognize the sender's name, and rightly deduced that she was not the intended recipient. She replied, pointing out the man's mistake, who then resent the e-mail to the proper address. What's the difference between a duck? I'm sorry, I was typing too quickly and missed off the end of my sentence.

A Mexican, a Texan, a Brit, and a Frenchman are flying on a plane when one of the engines goes out. The pilot comes out and says ""we're too heavy, one of you will have to jump!"" The Mexican looks at the Texan, the Brit looks at the Frenchmen, but they all decide that they don't want to jump out of the plane. The pilot attempts an emergency landing but without a runway and only 3 engines the plane hits at too harsh an angle and explodes. How do you make a blonde's eyes light up? Do something really nice for her, like buy her the piece of jewelry she looks at every time you go into the mall, or bake her a cake. If you have the time and effort, make her something. People appreciate thought and effort in a present more than money. Why don't Polish girls swim in the sea? The only sea that Poland borders on is the Baltic. Throughout most of the year this sea is too cold to comfortably swim in. There once was a man from Nantucket. He owned a sailboat. I haven't seen him in years. As their plane spirals towards the ground, a young man asks the pretty girl next to him if she would have sex with him, as he does not want to die a virgin. Surprised by this request, she declines, stating that in addition to the sheer inappropriateness of the idea, the mechanics of copulating in a crashing aircraft seem very difficult if not impossible. He agrees and admits that he was only trying to lighten the mood. However, she was busy putting on her oxygen mask and didn't hear this last bit. They both spend the last moments of their lives in anxious reflection. A man walks into a bar. He orders a couple of drinks, pays for them, and then proceeds to leave the premises, as his wife had told him that he must not be too late home. A horse walks into a bar. The barman immediately calls the local stable to report the missing stallion, and his owner promptly arrives to take him home. He thanks the landlord and offers a small reward, but it is respectfully declined. What's eighteen inches long, stiff, and makes women scream at night? A twelve inch long penis that is erect, thus adding approximately one half of its flaccid size, and involved in the act of fornication with the female partner of the man whose penis I am describing. (Of course, it is ignorant and juvenile to assume that the man in question is heterosexual. He may be a homosexual, which is perfectly acceptable in these liberal times we live in, or he may in fact be single and not inclined towards a sexual preference of any kind. This is understandable due to the myriad complications of long-term relationships, a result of the infinite differences between the masculine and feminine psyches.) PATIENT: Doctor doctor, I feel like a pair of curtains! DOCTOR: I shall prescribe you some anti-depressant tablets, probably 20 miligrams to start with, and I shall book you an appointment with a psychiatrist. You will not be charged for his or her services, but you may have to wait up to seven weeks for your first meeting. I shall give you two prescriptions just in case, so that you don't run the risk of running out of medication and thus relapsing. You will have to return in two months as your counseller is unable to provide you with drugs. Have a nice day. PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. My mother will be pleased and relieved that I have finally sought your advice after many years of this inner personal anguish and turmoil. DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Could you please send my next patient in? He should have a large beard, unless he recently has shaved it, which I consider unlikely. PATIENT: Certainly, doctor. And thank you again. What's the difference between Smarties and sleeping pills? Smarties are a popular chocolate-based confectionary product from England, which were the inspiration for the arguably more successful M&M's produced by Mars. Sleeping pills are flavourless narcotics that are used primarily by people suffering from afflictions such as insomnia. Another difference between the two is the repurcussions of ingestion. In a large dose, Smarties can have a minor contribution to obesity, whereas a large dose - often referred to as an 'overdose' - of sleeping pills runs the risk of much more dangerous consequences such as immediate and fatal liver damage. It is generally accepted that sleeping pills should only be used when recommended or prescribed by a qualified doctor or chemist, but Smarties can be purchased at the majority of reputable supermarkets or corner shops. How can you tell that your girlfriend's too young for you? Often the level of rapport enduced from conversations and activities is dependant on sharing mutual interests and beliefs. A significant age gap can compromise this, although it is not a concrete determiner of a relationship's potential success. Another thing to take into account is that the legal age for consentual sex is 16, although it is often (wrongly) considered a taboo for a man of 20 years or older to date a lady who is less than 18, the minimum legal age for drinking in the United Kingdom. However, when the roles are reversed it can be considered a positive trait for a younger man to have a mature partner. What do you call a man with a tray on his head? If you are aware of his given name, you may address him with this. If he had adopted a nickname by which he is comfortable to be known, using this would also be deemed acceptable. If, however, you do not already know what his name is, ask him to kindly inform you so that you may become acquainted. You may then ask him why he has a tray on his head, and he will quite likely answer you with humility and direct earnest. An Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotsman walk into a bar. They have a few drinks, then go to a club, where they amuse each other and those around them by completely slurring their words in their already very strong regional accents. Then they get a taxi back to the house of the Englishman as he lives nearest, and stay the night. The next morning, the Scotsman and the Irishmen walk home as they are still hungover and do not wish to risk driving. What do Madeleine McCann's parents have in common with Rhys Jones's parents? Both sets of parents outlived their infant children. (It is assumed, due to the substantial period of time since McCann went missing, that she is now deceased. However, this has yet to be confirmed by any official source.) Due to fewer intrinsic external differences between the facial structures of african people when compared to those of caucasians, Barack Obama is sometimes confused with Lewis Hamilton and Theo Walcott. Similarly, the current Israeli/Palestinian crisis is occasionally mistaken for that of footballer Paul Gascoigne. This is because Gascoigne was often endearingly known as 'Gazza', while the area of land most prominent in the Middle Eastern conflict is called Gaza - one letter away from the aforementioned 'Gazza', hence the confusion. A man walks into a pub and orders three pints. He sits down with them and drinks them all to himself, then goes back to the bar and orders another three pints. Once again, he drinks them all to himself and returns for three more pints. The barman, understandably rattled, asks him why he keeps ordering three at a time. The man explains that he has two riplet brothers, both in other countries, and they always have three pints at a time to pretend that they're together. The barman is touched by this. This continues for several months until one day the man comes in and only asks for two pints. The barman offers his condolences. The man thanks him, and somberly finishes his drinks, in the knowledge that he will never again see his beloved brother. What do you get if you cross a gooseberry with a stereo? A sticky green residue that is difficult to remove from the electrical unit. A man dies and goes to heaven. This is an assumption based on religious faith. Why can't Stephen Hawking dance? He has Motor Neurone syndrome. What's black, white, and hungry? The population of Zimbabwe. A man is walking through the desert, searching desperately for water. Suddenly, he stumbles across a stall. ""Do you have any water, please?"" he asks the merchant. ""Sorry mate, I only sell ties here"" is the reply. The man continues his increasingly futile bid for quenched thirst, and finally reaches another merchant. ""How can I help you, mate?"" ""Water! I need water!"" ""Well, you've come to the right place."" So the merchant gives the man some water, they shake hands, and have a long and hearty laugh over the redundancy of a tie shop in the desert.",human,5fwwv7,7,1480603569,0,22059,22059,4001,4.513371657085728,239

"A Donut's Vacation

So there's this donut and his birthday is today. It's Sunday and the donut says to himself...\""You know what I think I'm going to take the day off and go enjoy myself.\"" The Donut hasn't taken time off in about 3 months so he decides that he's going to go spend the day down at the local pier. \n\nSo he goes to the pier and starts rolling around or whatever donuts do. He's at the pier for several hours before a man walks up to him and says \""Hey you know I've seen you rolling around here for a while, do you need help with something?\"" The donut replies to the man \""It's my birthday today and I'm not sure what I want to do.\"" The man laughs and says to the donut \""you know I heard there's a cruise ship pulling out of here in a couple hours...if you make it down to the travel agency I'm sure you can grab a ticket and have yourself a few days to relax!\"" The donut replies \""you know what? That's a great idea, I think I'll do just that...yeah I could use a few days off from work.\"" The donut quickly runs back home packs his bags and gets a ticket from the travel agency and boards the cruise ship ecstatic for his journey.\n\n\""Wow, this is amazing!\"" the donut says. The donut's having a great time on the cruise, he's rolling around the decks, tanning in the sun, sprinkles blowing in the wind...whatever it is donuts do to have fun. So the donut gets this great idea all of a sudden...\""gee it's my birthday today, I think I'll ask the captain if he'll let me drive the ship...after all it is my birthday! That's not a bad idea, why not?!\"" \n\nSo the donut goes up to the bridge and says \""Captain Captain it's my birthday today can you please let me drive the ship.\"" The Captain says \""No get the fuck out of here!\"" and he kicks the donut out. \n\nThe donut looks confused and goes back to his cabin for a bit...then he says to himself \""you know what? I bet the Captain was just really busy when I went up there, I'll just go up there and ask him again. He definitely won't turn me down this time!\"" So the donut goes back up to the bridge again and says to the Captain \""Captain Captain can you please let me drive the boat, it's my birthday today I'd love to drive the boat!\"" The Captain says \""No, get the fuck out of here, if you come up here again I'll have you thrown overboard!\"" \n\nAgain, the donut looks disappointed and returns to his cabin and takes a nap for a few hours. He wakes up and says to himself \""You know, the Captain must have been really busy earlier! If I go back up there now and ask to drive the boat there's no way he'll turn me down! He just can't!\"" The donut rolls off eager as always and makes his way to the bridge. He rolls into the bridge and says \""Captain Captain will you please let me drive the boat?\"" \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\nWhat do you think happens next?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n*The Captain threw the Donut overboard.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nSo a man decides he's going to propose to his girlfriend, he's absolutely in love with this girl so he's got the perfect proposal planned. He takes her out to this bluff overlooking the ocean. It's a beautiful sunny day. The man set up a picnic and the two are jamming out to music on his iphone...everything is going perfect. \n\nSo he finally feels like it's time to propose...he bought her the most expensive beautiful ring that he hand picked at the jewelry store. He spent his entire life savings on this ring. He reaches out into his back pocket and as he goes to get down on one knee to propose he slips and drops the ring over the bluff into the water...gone forever. His whole life savings wasted away. His girlfriend looks at him and says \""You know what, I love you and I want to marry you anyway. I know it'll be hard but we can make it work!\"" \n\nSo a couple weeks pass by and the couple have been having to work long hours to pay their bills. They decide that they should go out for a nice expensive date to relax from all the extra work they've been doing to make up for the ring he bought. The man takes his fiance out to a nice expensive seafood restauraunt and he orders himself a nice lobster and she orders a plate of hot steamy oysters. Just as his fiance opens the first oyster she screams and drops it on the table. The mans eyes are wide open in shock at what's inside...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**IT'S THE DONUT!!!!!!!!!!!!**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is a great joke to tell your friends. It's especially great if you want to get someone in particular since this joke can be told in two parts, the donut part and the proposal part. I've even spanned this joke out over several days...or just as little as ten minutes.

"The Clown Joke (WARNING: Very Long)

Once upon a time – which is a terrible way to start a joke – there was a little boy named Billy. Billy was six years old, and for the whole of his short life, he had been utterly and intensely obsessed with clowns. He had clown bed sheets and clown posters; he had clown toys and clown-themed games; he had towels with clowns on them, a toothbrush in the shape of a clown, and – if it had existed – he probably would have used clown-flavored toothpaste, as well. Try not to think about it. The point here is that Billy loved clowns, and his parents were well aware of that fact. (They'd have to be, right? I mean, how is a six-year-old going to buy all of that stuff on his own?) Thus, they decided that for their son's seventh birthday, they'd purchase front-row seats at the circus, which *just happened* to be in town at the same time. Upon hearing this, Billy was absolutely overcome with excitement, and he was scarcely able to sit still until his family arrived at the big top. Billy and his parents walked in, took their seats, and waited for the show to start. The music flared to life and the lights came up, and in a dazzling display of merriment, everything began. First came the lion-tamers with their whips and chairs... and yeah, they were intriguing, but they didn't hold Billy's interest. Next came the feats of strength with strongmen (and one excessively suspicious woman) smashing bricks and bending bars... and yeah, it was impressive, but Billy didn't really care. The sword swallowers followed, and the trapeze artists, and the tightrope walkers... and yeah, someone might have died at any moment, but it all seemed so *boring*. Eventually, Billy began to worry that he wouldn't get to see clowns at the circus. After all, he knew very well that clowns usually only appeared when something went wrong. (You didn't know that, did you? Yeah, clowns are typically kept on standby in case someone screws up.) Suddenly, all of the lights went out. A single spotlight shown down to one corner of the arena. A tiny car came puttering into view, while discordant, almost forlorn circus music played. *Deet deet deedle-deedle deet deet dee deeeeee...* The car's doors sprang open, and out poured the most amazing collection of clowns that Billy had ever seen! There were fat clowns, thin clowns, tall clowns, short clowns! Clowns with bright red hair and enormous red noses! Clowns in silly suspenders and oversize shoes! There were clowns wearing every color of the rainbow, and clowns that moved like psychotic ferrets on speed! There were more clowns than Billy had ever *dreamed* of watching all at once! Then, just as it seemed like that tiny car couldn't produce a single soul more, another clown stepped out. He was too fat to be thin, yet too thin to be fat... but somehow wasn't average, either. He was too short too be tall, yet too tall to be short... but still managed to be both at once. He had pale, almost white skin – not the product of makeup – and deep, almost black, sunken eyes. He had a shock of bright red (and completely natural) hair, and a bulbous, equally red nose.

"Nun at Hooters.

A nun, badly needing to use to the restroom, walked into a local Hooters. The place was hopping with music and loud conversation and every once in a while ‘the lights would turn off.’ Each time the lights would go out, the place would erupt into cheers. However, when the revelers saw the nun,the room went dead silent. She walked up to the bartender, and asked, ‘May I please use the restroom? The bartender replied, ‘OK, but I should warn you that there is a statue of a naked man in there wearing only a fig leaf.”Well, in that case, I’ll just look the other way,’ said the nun. So the bartender showed the nun to the back of the restaurant. After a few minutes, she came back out, and the whole place stopped just long enough to give the nun a loud round of applause. She went to the bartender and said, ‘Sir, I don’t understand. Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom?’ Well, now they know you’re one of us,’ said the bartender, ‘Would you like a drink?’ ‘No thank you, but, I still don’t understand,’said the puzzled nun. ‘You see,’ laughed the bartender, ‘every time someone lifts the fig leaf on that statue, the lights go out.

"[Long] A guy wanted to lose weight

There's a guy. We'll call him Bob. Bob is a fat slob, but one day decides that he's going to turn things around and start getting in shape. So he sees an ad for a new workout program, and calls the number. The operator agrees to start him off with a one-month trial of their lowest level program, and tells Bob to be ready to go running first thing in the morning, and someone will be out to his house.\n\nSo first thing in the morning, hes all dressed and ready, and hears a knock on the door. He opens the door and sees the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. Just eye-poppingly gorgeous. She's wearing a T-shirt that reads \""If you catch me, you can have me\"". And without a word, she takes off running.\n\nWell Bob takes off after her. He chases her several blocks before he's just to tired to continue and collapses on the pavement. After a bit to catch his breath, he gets up and realizes she's long gone, and he doesn't even know which way she went, so he just has to go home.\n\nThe next day, there's another knock on his door. Same girl, same T-shirt, same drill as before. He still doesn't catch her, but he gets a few blocks farther before he's forced to stop. This process is repeated for the whole month, and while Bob never manages to catch up to her, he does lose a lot of weight trying.\n\nAfter the last session, he gets a phone call from the program, asking how his trial month went, and if he'd like to try the next-level program. It's a more strenuous program, not for the faint of heart, but if Bob wants to give it a go, they'll let him try it. Bob, decides to give it a shot.\n\nNext morning, there's a knock on the door. It's a new girl with the same T-shirt, so beautiful that she makes the previous one look like a snaggle-toothed hag by comparison. The sort of woman Bob didn't even think could really exists. She flashes him a quick smile that makes his heart melt and takes off running even faster than the first girl. Bob chases after her even harder and more determined than before, and manages to keep up with her for several miles before falling out. Like before, this continues on for the whole month, Bob getting more in shape and managing to run further and faster each time.\n\nThe last day of the month comes by, and Bob is ready and waiting. By this time, he's a lean, mean running machine. He gets up before dawn to warm up and stretch, eat a good breakfast, and make sure he's well hydrated. So when that knock on the door comes, it's off to the races.\n\nThe girl takes off at a dead sprint, but Bob follows right on her heels. She runs up and down every street in town, mile after mile, juking and weaving and doing everything she can to lose Bob, but Bob is in shape now and keeps right on her heels. All day he chases her around town, and then, after running a virtual marathon around town, he finally catches her, and he has her.\n\nSo Bob is feeling pretty good about himself now. He's gone from a fat slob that no woman would give the time of day to to a stud that's banging supermodels. But he wonders if this is really as far as he can go. So he calls up the number and asks if there's any other programs. The salesman hesitates before answering, then tells him that yes, they do have one more level of program, but it's only for the *most* dedicated clients and he doesn't really think it's suitable for Bob. But Bob is pretty self-confident now, so he insists. After a while, he eventually gets the salesman to relent sign him up for the top level program.\n\nMorning comes, and Bob hears a knock on the door. Given that he'd thought the first girl was practically a perfect 10, and the second one was even better, he's anxious to see what the best one looks like. He opens the door, and sees a gigantic brute of a man, at least seven feet tall and sporting what looks like 300 pounds of pure muscle. The brute has a cruel smirk on his face that makes Bob's blood freeze in is veins, and is staring directly at Bob the way a lion stares at a wounded zebra.\n\nBob looks at the man's T-shirt, which reads \""If I catch you, I get to keep you\"".",ai,ai_5863,0,0,1,4131,4131,780,4.296153846153846,45

After Quasimodo's death, the bishop of the cathedral of Notre Dame sent word through the streets of Paris that a new bellringer was needed. The bishop decided that he would conduct the interviews personally and went up into the belfry to begin the screening process. After observing several applicants demonstrate their skills, he decided to call it a day when a lone, armless man approached him and announced that he was there to apply for the bellringer's job. The bishop was incredulous. ""You have no arms!"" ""No matter,"" said the man, ""Observe!"" He then began striking the bells with his face, producing a beautiful melody on the carillon. The bishop listened in astonishment, convinced that he had finally found a suitable replacement for Quasimodo. Suddenly, rushing forward to strike a bell, the armless man tripped, and plunged headlong out of the belfry window to his death in the street below. The stunned bishop rushed to his side. When he reached the street, a crowd had gathered around the fallen figure, drawn by the beautiful music they had heard only moments before. As they silently parted to let the bishop through, one of them asked, ""Bishop, do you know who this man is?""

The American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellow fin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied, “Only a little while.” The American then asked, “Why didn’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” The Mexican said, “With this I have more than enough to support my family’s needs.” The American then asked, “But what do you do with the rest of your time?” The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life.” The American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing; and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat: With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor; eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York where you will run your ever-expanding enterprise.” The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?” To which the American replied, “15 to 20 years.” “But what then?” asked the Mexican. The American laughed and said that’s the best part. “When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.” “Millions?…Then what?” The American said, “Then you would retire.

He was terrified of what would happen so he fled the scene (and, eventually, the city) before police and rescue crews could arrive.\n\nHe settled in Houston under an assumed name and took a job in a grocery store, trying to keep as low a profile as possible. He lived a quiet life, and every day he would watch the Houston cable-cars going up and down the street and he longed for what he had lost. One day, he decided that he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school again, this time in Houston and under his new name. He did a little better this time, having been through the classwork before, and graduated with a B average and was assigned to a nice route in La Porte. His passengers loved him and he loved his job. But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable car. It hopped its track and ended up in Trinity Bay. All of his passengers were killed, but Harry managed to swim back to shore. Fearing that authorities would put this accident together with the one in New York, he again fled the scene.\n\nThis time he ended up in San Francisco with yet another assumed name. He figured that, if he couldn't operate his beloved cable cars (for fear of getting caught), he could at least see them everywhere he went, as San Francisco is the cable-car capital of the world. This satisfied him for a little while, but eventually he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school yet again. He excelled in his classwork this time around (having been through the program twice before) and graduated magna cum laude. He was assigned the highly-coveted Market Street route and drove it for quite a while without incident. But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable-car. It hopped its tracks and ended up in the San Francisco Bay. All of his passengers were killed and as Harry swam back to shore, the police were waiting for him.\n\nIn the subsequent investigation and trial, prosecutors put all the pieces together. They figured that he was the same guy who killed all those people in Houston and New York. It was the trial of the century and at the end of it, Harry was sentenced to die in the electric chair for his crimes (the actions having been deemed so egregiously willful and persistent as to constitute premeditation). He was transferred to Alcatraz to await his execution.\nHe was a model prisoner, never causing any trouble, and every day he woke and did exactly 52 jumping jacks and 52 sit-ups and 52 push-ups in his cell to keep himself occupied. The day before his scheduled execution, the warden came to him and asked what he would like for his last meal. Harry thought about it for a minute and said “I would like a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk”. The warden stared blankly at him. “Harry,” he said, “we have access to the best chefs in the world. This is your last meal, and you can have anything you want. Steak, lobster, name it!” Harry shook his head and repeated his request for a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk. His disgusting meal was brought to him and he wolfed it down hungrily. The next day, his head was shaved and last rites were administered, and Harry was led to the electric chair and hooked up. At the appointed time, prison guards threw the switch and counted to ten before turning off the current to the chair. But Harry was fine. Smoldering a bit at the spots where the contacts met his skin, perhaps, but otherwise the picture of health.\n\nFlummoxed, the guards took Harry back to his cell and began the long process of checking and rechecking their equipment for malfunctions, but they couldn’t find anything. A new execution date was set for one month later, and Harry went back to his morning exercise routine of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups to keep his mind and body occupied while he waited.\n\nThe eve of his second execution arrived and the warden visited Harry again to take the order for his last meal. “A rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk,” Harry said. The warden just shook his head and asked him Harry was sure, then arranged to have his meal brought to him. The next day, guards shaved his head again, Harry was administered his last rites again, and he was marched to the electric chair and hooked up again. This time, though, they weren’t taking any chances. At the appropriate time, they threw the switch and left the juice flowing for a full minute. And when they were finished, Harry was just fine.\n\nThe warden was nervous. A little known California law stipulated that the state could only make three attempts to execute a prisoner, and if that failed they had to let him go. Harry was returned to his cell where he resumed his daily morning exercise regimen of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups. Another month passed, and on the eve of his third execution, Harry was visited by the warden, who just said “let me guess” as he wheeled in a cart with a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk. Harry thanked him politely and ate his dinner. The next morning, they shaved his head (AGAIN!) and delivered last rites (AGAIN!) and marched him to the execution chamber, where he was hooked up (AGAIN!) to the electric chair. This time, prison officials weren’t taking any chances. The entire Bay Area power grid was diverted to Alcatraz. They threw the switch (cutting electricity to millions of customers) and left the juice running for a full half hour. The execution chamber buzzed with the awesome power being fed into the chair. You could taste the ions in the air. And when they turned off the power….\n\nHarry was just fine. The warden shook his head in disbelief. “Well, Harry,” he said, “we have to let you go. California law stipulates that we can only make three attempts at an execution. But before I do, I really have to know. How did you survive three executions? Was it the jumping jacks, the sit-ups, and the push-ups? Was it the rotten banana, rotten apple, and spoiled milk? What IS your secret?”\n\n\nHarry just shook his head and shrugged, “I guess I’m just not a very good conductor.”",ai,ai_6620,0,0,1,6776,6776,1215,4.576954732510288,69

"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.

His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.

There is no middle ground here.\n\nDICK CHENEY: Where's my gun?\n\nCOLIN POWELL: Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road.\n\nBILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken.\n\nAL GORE: I invented the chicken.\n\nJOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it.\n\nAL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white?\n\nDR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he is acting by not taking on his current problems before adding any new problems.\n\nOPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross the road so badly. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a NEW CAR so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.\n\nANDERSON COOPER: We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.\n\nNANCY GRACE: That chicken crossed the road because he's guilty! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.\n\nPAT BUCHANAN: To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.\n\nMARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way the chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.\n\nDR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told.\n\nERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die in the rain, alone.\n\nJERRY FALWELL: Because the chicken was gay! Can't you people see the plain truth? That's why they call it the 'other side.' Yes, my friends, that chicken was gay. If you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the Liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like 'the other side.' That chicken should not be crossing the road. It's as plain and as simple as that.\n\nGRANDPA: In my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.\n\nBARBARA WALTERS: Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heart warming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish it's lifelong dream of crossing the road.\n\nARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.\n\nJOHN LENNON: Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together, in peace.\n\nBILL GATES: I have just released eChicken2013, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents and balance your checkbook.

Given the recent slowdown in iPhone sales, Apple announced today that it will skip the wearables market and develop a line of digital implants for adults. The first product, shipping in the summer of 2016, is a breast enhancement device that can store and play music. The new Apple iBoobs, sold in pairs, will cost from $499 to $699 depending on cup and speaker size.

"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.

His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.

"A musician performs at a nightclub everyday.

The musician, Joe is known by the regulars to be of the most unoriginal artists. Every day, he sings the same song that his sister wrote in eight grade. The regulars actively despise him for singing the song every day, but sometimes newcomers enjoy it. \n\nOn one particular day, an executive of a record label comes to the nightclub looking for new talents to sign with him. When he comes across Joe, he is stunned by the talent he saw in him. The regulars laughed as they saw the idiot executive sign with Joe.\n\nHowever, Joe is soon a rising star in the music industry. Although he only performed a single song, it was almost on the Top 100 songs of that week. People began to request that he write more songs and he agreed.\n\nThe problem was that Joe had no idea how to write a song. His manager refused to let him get a songwriter as the song had to come from his heart, like the manager thought the first song did. Joe kept trying to write a good song, but his mind was blank.\n\nMeanwhile, the song suddenly became the top song of the year. Everybody was singing it, but lots of people thought that he was only going to be a one-hit wonder. It all worsened when Joe's sister first heard her brother singing the song.\n\nJoe's sister immediately published proof that she was the one who came up with the song idea and that her brother stole it. Some of the crowd turned on Joe, but the majority of his fans stuck with Joe and defended him, saying that they never would have heard the song if Joe hadn't copied it.\n\nHowever, this experience was the inspiration that Joe needed to write his own song. He promised his fans that it would be an original song. He worked for days trying to perfect it, and once he was satisfied, he was ready to perform.\n\nHe refused to let anybody hear the song before he went out on stage. \n\nOnce he got on the stage he said \""Hey guys, this is a new song that I wrote myself. I wanted to share it with all of you because it reflects what's really in my heart. This song speaks about how I was like and what I did before I became a hit artist after stealing my sister's song. It also speaks to all of you haters out there, who call me a no good thief. Queue the music!\"" \n\nThe lights dimmed and the audience became quiet. Then, the music started but it was unexpected. It was one that they were very well familiar with, when Joe started to sing.\n\n\""This-post-shit-oh\n\nCare bout' reposts are to kill-o this petite Joe \nThey yell \""K\"" to nag and cause a Ailed, oh weak Joe \nParents tell their a-children say 'Not a star, con me Joe?'\n\nOnce he was done with his song, the whole crowd started cheering. \""Great performance!\"" his manager said, completely ignoring the fact that he ripped off Despacito. \""We don't even need to call this a parody, it's a completely new song!\""\n\nMany years past, and Joe became famous in the music industry for plagiarism. However, his fans still continued to defend him saying that \""He did the original writers a favor by spreading their music.\"" Some songwriters complained that when they first wrote the song, they only got 100,000 hits but Joe was getting billions. \n\nOne day, Joe got sick of the hate. He said \""Fuck this,\"" and decided to actually write an original song. It took him years and years to devise this masterpiece and he finally completed it.\n\nWhen he handed it in to his manager, the manager shook his head. \""This song's a piece of shit\"" the manager said. \""But... I spent years working on it\"" exclaimed Joe. \""It took 1000x more effort than my other songs\"".\n\nThe manager looked and him and replied \""Go ahead, put it to the test. Let me know when they laugh you off the stage.\""\n\nOnce Joe sang the song at his next concert, his ratings plummeted. Everyone disliked his new music and called it boring, long, and meaningless. He left the stage disgraced, and was met by his gloating manager.\n\nThe manager started speaking \""You know, they have this saying where I come from. People would rather hear something good a million times than an original piece that was a disaster only once.\""\n\n\""Was my song really that bad?\"" Joe asked, disgraced.\n\n\""Yeah, but that's not what I'm talking about\"" said the manager. \""This fucking post is a mess of shit that I can't even begin to describe. I have no idea how any of you actually read through that whole thing. There's no punchline except for this and the writer was obviously drunk at noon while writing this.

"Farting in bed

This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years, the only friction in their marriage was the husbands habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke the noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, Honey you were right all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you. What do you mean? asked his wife.

"When Beethoven passed away...

...He was buried in a churchyard. A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate. When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony being played backwards.""

After repetitive failure from his mother, he asked his dad. “Please father, please, all my friends are playing it!” But his father denied him as well. \n\nTed was really angry and all he wanted to do was play online with his friends every once in a while. He thought he’d take matters into his own hands and he stole his fathers computer and hid it in his room. That night he played with his friends for hours and hours until morning, then he secretly stayed home and played all day.\n\nHis dad didn’t notice until that afternoon, when he walked into his office and his computer was missing, so he asked his son Ted if he touched it. Ted owned up and gave the computer back, but had a tantrum afterwards. “WHY DON’T I GET TO PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS” he yelled in tears. \n\nFeeling pity, his dad finally bought him a laptop.

"'Economic Stimulus' payment

Sometime this year, we taxpayers will again receive another 'Economic Stimulus' payment. This is indeed a very exciting program, and I'll explain it by using a Q & A format: Q. What is an 'Economic Stimulus' payment ? A. It is money that the federal government will send to taxpayers. Q.. Where will the government get this money ? A. From taxpayers. Q. So the government is giving me back my own money ? A. Only a smidgen of it. Q. What is the purpose of this payment ? A. The plan is for you to use the money to purchase a high-definition TV set, thus stimulating the economy. Q. But isn't that stimulating the economy of China ? A. Shut up. Below is some helpful advice on how to best help the U.S. economy by spending your stimulus check wisely: * If you spend the stimulus money at Wal-Mart, the money will go to China or Sri Lanka . * If you spend it on gasoline, your money will go to the Arabs. * If you purchase a computer, it will go to India , Taiwan or China . * If you purchase fruit and vegetables, it will go to Mexico , Honduras and Guatemala ... * If you buy an efficient car, it will go to Japan or Korea . * If you purchase useless stuff, it will go to Taiwan . * If you pay your credit cards off, or buy stock, it will go to management bonuses and they will hide it offshore. Instead, keep the money in America by: 1) Spending it at yard sales, or 2) Going to ball games, or 3) Spending it on prostitutes, or 4) Beer or 5) Tattoos. (These are the only American businesses still operating in the U.S. ) Conclusion: Go to a ball game with a tattooed prostitute that you met at a yard sale and drink beer all day !

"Last week, I was at a yard sale

I was immediately attracted to this shiny red drum kit. I had always had dreams of being a rock star and here was a chance to indulge my fantasies. It was also shiny and red. Oh, and the price was only $10. So I inquired about purchasing the set. --- ""For $10, I'll take this monstrosity and you won't need to worry about finding a place to keep it anymore."" ""Are you kidding?"" ""No, I'll give you $10 right now and take it away immediately."" ""Are you sure you know what you're doing?"" ""Yes, I'm purchasing a shiny red drum set."" ""But this drum set is cursed."" ""Cursed, you say?"" ""Yes, cursed."" ""Are you interested in selling it or not?"" ""Well, I guess I just want to get rid of it. But my conscience would never be at rest if I thought I had forced someone to take these drums."" ""They're shiny and red and I want them."" ""Well then, I guess you can have them."" --- Ignoring the warning, I went ahead and packed up the whole set and proceeded to bring them home. On the drive, I couldn't help but keep looking back at them with all of their shiny redness. I guess I must have been a little distracted and wasn't paying attention to where I was driving. Which is why I parked in my neighbors driveway. He seemed a slight bit upset about that. After finding my own driveway, I proceeded to unpack the drums and assemble them. There was a kick drum, a snare, three toms, a hi-hat and a ride cymbal. As I placed them, I couldn't help but notice my reflection upon the shiny red surface. I stood and admired their beauty. The next day, I thought that I should try playing the drums. It was then that I noticed that I didn't have any drumsticks. So I looked around to see if I had anything that might resemble a drumstick. The best I could manage was some extra chopsticks from my favorite restaurant, ""The Red Dragon."" I knew it wasn't exactly the same, but at least the color matched. I stood behind the drums and started to give it a try. Now, my neighbor must have very sensitive hearing, because not long after I started, he arrived upon my doorstep, complaining about all the racket. --- ""What are you doing?"" ""Yesterday, I bought a shiny red drum set and today I was overcome with the desire to try and play them."" ""Well, I happen to be a well-trained musician and I can tell you now, that those drums sound terrible. I have perfect pitch and I tell you that they are completely out of tune."" ""Really? I had no idea drums could be out of tune, but I guess I'll take your word for it."" --- He then proceeded over to the drums and gave them a look all over. I could see his reflection upon the shiny surface as he surveyed the whole of them. After a few minutes, he proceeded to gather up the whole lot and walked out the door with them. Anxious to not see my dreams disappear, I immediately set to follow him. As I exited the house, I saw him taking a good, measured wind up and then he proceeded to demonstrate his perfect pitch.

"Funeral

As a guitarist, I play many gigs. Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost.\n\nI finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.\n\nI felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.\n\nThe workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.\n\nAnd as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car.

A nun, really needing to go to the bathroom, walked into a neighborhood pub. The place was hopping with music and dancing but every once in a while the lights would turn off. Each time after the lights would go out the place would erupt into cheers. However, when the revelers saw the nun, the room went dead silent. She walked up to the bartender, and asked,"" May I please use the restroom?"" The bartender replied, ""I really don't think you should."" ""Why not? "" the nun asked. ""Well, there is a statue of a naked man in there, and his most private part is covered only by a fig leaf. "" ""Nonsense,"" said the nun, ""I'll just look the other way."" So the bartender showed the nun the door at the top of the stairs, and she proceeded to the restroom. After a few minutes, she came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and dancing again. However, they did stop just long enough to give the nun a loud round of applause. She went to the bartender and said, ""Sir, I don't understand. Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom?"" ""Well, now they know you're one of us,"" said the bartender. ""Would you like a drink?"" ""But, I still don't understand,"" said the puzzled nun.

"In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana State University.

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day. \n\nTwenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man. Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly. Probably wasn't the same fucking elephant. \n\nThis is for everyone who sends me those heart-warming bullshit stories.",ai,ai_6751,0,0,1,1755,1755,299,4.869565217391305,19

Since i was a young boy my father has imposed his religion onto me. I was home schooled because we live in the west and my father wanted me in an environment that was free from anything Haram.

After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram.

I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Hindus and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae.",ai,ai_19,0,0,1,1581,1581,316,4.003164556962025,19
"For years I was searching for...

For years I was searching for the music of a korean show called 'Rep'. I searched all my life for that music. A good part of my life was attached to thaf show. But I cant find it. I lost all my hopes in it. Now when I am near my death bed, some months ago I get used to reddit. What a womderful place it is. Soo many subreddits. I scrolled for days and days but never got bored. Then I came to know that we can ask about many things you want to find. The first thing that clicked my mind was that show. So I made a post asking about Where can I find the OST of that show. I got many answers like YT, Spotify but I had searched every place and that music was nowhere. I was desperate to find that music as I know my days are near. Then after many moons, I got a notification on that post. With a surprise I read that comment. It was of a girl. That comment told me to search for that music on r/Jokes. I was amazed. Why on earth r/Jokes started giving OSTs and songs and music. I asked her for the reason. She replied,"" look sir, the only place where you can find your music is r/Jokes because r/Jokes is full of 'Rep' OSTs.",human,c7b9x1,3,1561886994,0,1157,1157,236,3.902542372881356,23

"A girl walks into a tattoo parlor and explains that she's always wanted a tattoo of her favorite country music star on the inside of her thigh...

She's really conflicted though, because she can't decide between her two favorites, Conway Twitty or George Jones. The tattoo artist offers a solution: he would do both Conway Twitty AND George Jones, one on each thigh, for only $200 with a free money-back guarantee...if she doesn't like his work, she doesn't have to pay. She agrees that's a hell of a deal, so she hops up in the chair, hikes up her skirt and the tattoo artist goes straight to work. He works with dedication and concentration throughout most of the day, first on one thigh and then the other. Hours pass before he finally finishes. He stands up and admires his work and holding a mirror between the girl's knees, he asks her what she thinks of the two tattoos. ""That looks nothing like Conway Twitty OR George Jones,"" the girl shouts, ""and I'm not paying you one damn dollar!"" ""The hell you're not,"" replied the tattoo artist, ""this is some of the best work I've ever done!"" ""BULLSHIT!"" screams the girl, ""I ain't paying!"" The artist has an idea. ""Tell you what,"" he says, ""let's put it to a vote. We'll go outside and ask the first person we see what they think of the tattoos. If they can recognize Conway & George, you're paying! If not, they're free."" The girl agrees, and the two walk outside. There happens to be a homeless man, clearly drunk and sitting on the sidewalk outside the tattoo shop, and the tattoo artist approaches him and explains their predicament and asks the man to judge the tattoos to see if he can recognize who they are. The homeless man agrees to help, so the girl walks over to where he is sitting, lifts her skirt and opens her legs in the man's face so he can get a good look at the two tattoos. The homeless man, stroking his chin, carefully studies first one tattoo, then the other, then goes back to the first.

"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam...

His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated. The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""",human,ap904y,89,1549836088,0,2476,2476,438,4.65296803652968,34

"Mbeki and his elephant

Mbeki was a boy who live in a small village on the edge of the great Serengeti plain of Africa. Mbeki would spend days watching the animals on the plain, learning and studying their behaviors.\n\nTwice a year during the great animal migration from their summer to their winter feeding grounds and back, the villagers would gather their meagre belongings and hide in caves in the hills above their village. When they returned, they would find that their village had been ravaged by marauding elephants that would strip the straw and logs from their mud huts for food.\n\nAfter one devastating year when the village was almost completely destroyed, Mbeki vowed to learn as much as he could about elephants to help his village. \n\nOne day as he sat hidden in the tall grass he saw an old bull elephant with a broken tusk that appeared to be in distress. As Mbeki crawlled closer to observe, he noticed that the elephant was holding one foot off the ground. Mbeki crawed closer still and saw there was blood on the elephant's foot. \n\nMbeki stood and approached the elephant nervously and saw a large thorn stuck beneath the elephant's foot. Screwing up his courage Mbeki held the elephant's foot in one hand and pulled at the thorn with all his might with his other hand. The thorn came loose at last, Mbeki gave a shout of triumph and the elephant gave a loud trumpet. \n\nSuddenly the elephant wrapped his trunk around Mbeki and lifted him high off the ground and Mbeki and the elephant looked at each other. Mbeki saw joy and thankfulness in the elephant's wise old eyes. After a long while the elephant gently placed Mbeki on the ground and stamped his front foot on the ground three times and slowly turned and walked away. \n\nAfter that day Mbeki vowed to double his efforts to learn all he could about the elephants. Soon he became famous for his knowledge throughout the land and was invited by neighbouring villages and cities and countries to talk about his experiences. \n\nMany years later, Mbeki now an old man after a long career travelling the world as the world's foremost expert on elephants finds himself back in the village he had lived as a child. But oh how it had grown, no longer a small dusty village of mud tracks and mud huts it was a modern city filled with all the trappings of modernity and a million people. It even had it's own zoo. Mbeki decides to visit. Mbeki walked around the animal enclosures smiling, remembering his life as a boy when suddenlh behind him he heard an elephant blow his trumpet. \n\nMbeki turn and there, in front of him, an elephant with a broken task with it's trunk raised. They looked at each other, the elephant stamped it's feet on the ground three times.

The elephant wrapped his trunk around Mbeki and lifted him off the ground and once again Mbeki could stare into those wise old elephant eyea. \n\nSuddenly the elephant threw Mbeki hard onto the ground and stamped on Mbeki's head three time killing him. \n\nIt was a different elephant.",ai,ai_1691,0,0,1,3201,3201,562,4.695729537366548,29

"In 1964, a couple of former St. Louis Cardinals baseball stars were on vacation in Wales....

Red Schoendienst and Stan Musial decided to head to the UK on vacation with their wives after the 1964 Major League Baseball season. The two had retired as players the year before and had just finished their first full season as members of the staff - Musial as vice president, Schoendienst as a coach - and they decided to take a couple of weeks and go all around the UK. They landed in London, went up and through Scotland, and were spending a night in Wales. As they had gone, a few people happily recognized Red, mainly American tourists, but Stan was something else. \n\nEverywhere the 4 of them went, the people just seemed to automatically get a great affection for him. Whether it was Americans on vacation as well, or well-to-do Londoners or blue-collar workers in the Black Country or farmers in Scotland, he somehow just was able to create an automatic rapport with everyone.\n\nAnd so it was, this night in Wales. The two couples were sitting at a table in a night club, enjoying a couple drinks and the music being performed there. After a little while, this 20-something crooner came out and the four of them were amazed at this young man's awesome voice. After he was done, Red and Stan wanted to offer some kind words to him, so Stan talked to the manager and after a moment or two, the manager brought them backstage to meet the singer, a young man named Tom Jones.\n\nRed and Stan introduced themselves to the Welshman, who had heard of the two future Hall of Famers, but was surprised that a pair of American sports stars had wanted to meet him, just some young guy singing in a club. Nonsense, they told him. They had seen that he had a special talent, and that, with hard work and a little luck, he could be a huge star.\n\nThe young man thanked them and they talked for about another 15 minutes before Stan and Red asked Tom to join them and their wives for a drink. He thought for a moment and then agreed.\n\nIt was here that Tom noticed that all the staff were so nice to Stan. The servers, who were occasionally a little preoccupied, were acting like he was a favorite uncle. The bartender was already on a first-name basis with him. Even the manager, who Tom had known for over a year and just started to warm up to him, was openly friendly with the American baseball star. Tom was stunned by this change of attitude in everyone and pulled Red aside for a moment to ask him about it:\n\n\""Red, you and Stan never were here before, right?\""\n\n\""Right.\""\n\n\""Then how come everyone seems to be on such good terms with Stan?\""\n\n\""It's just something with him. That happens everywhere we go. It's been like that for years. There's just something about his personality. He said his father was like that as well.\""\n\n\""Wow, Red. That must be something amazing. It just seems so strange to me to be able to make people that happy that fast.\""\n\nRed Schoendienst put his arm around the young singer and chuckled and told him:\n\n\""Ah, you see, Tom Jones, it's not un-Musial to be loved by anyone.\""",ai,ai_708,0,0,1,3117,3117,555,4.616216216216216,32

"Alerts to Threats in Europe

The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent events in Syria and have therefore raised their security level from “Miffed” to “Peeved.” Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to “Irritated” or even “A Bit Cross.” The English have not been “A Bit Cross” since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorized from “Tiresome” to “A Bloody Nuisance.” The last time the British issued a “Bloody Nuisance” warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.\n\nThe Scots have raised their threat level from “Pissed Off” to “Let’s get the Bastards.” They don’t have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.\n\nThe French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from “Run” to “Hide.” The only two higher levels in France are “Collaborate” and “Surrender.” The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France ‘s white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country’s military capability.\n\nItaly has increased the alert level from “Shout Loudly and Excitedly” to “Elaborate Military Posturing.” Two more levels remain: “Ineffective Combat Operations” and “Change Sides.”\n\nThe Germans have increased their alert state from “Disdainful Arrogance” to “Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.” They also have two higher levels: “Invade a Neighbour” and “Lose.”\n\nBelgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels .\n\nThe Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.\n\nAustralia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from “No worries” to “She’ll be alright, Mate.” Two more escalation levels remain: “Crikey! I think we’ll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!” and “The barbie is cancelled.” So far no situation has ever warranted use of the last final escalation level.\n\nA final thought – ” Greece is collapsing, the Iranians are getting aggressive, and Rome is in disarray.

"Gunfighter

A Cowboy sitting in a saloon one Saturday night recognized an elderly man standing at the bar who in his day had the reputation of being the fastest gun in the West. The young cowboy took a place next to the old timer, bought him a drink and told him the story of his great ambition. “Do you think you could give me some tips?” he asked.\n\nThe old man looked him up and down and said, “Well, for one thing, you're wearing your gun too high. Tie the holster a little lower down on your leg.”\n“Will that make me a better gunfighter?” asked the young man.\n\n“Sure will,” replied the old timer.\nThe young man did as he was told, stood up, whipped out his .44 and shot the bow tie off the piano player. “That's terrific!” said the hot shot. “Got any more tips for me?”\n“Yep,” said the old man. “Cut a notch out of your holster where the hammer hits it. That'll give you a smoother draw.”\n“Will that make me a better gunfighter?” asked the younger man.\n\n“You bet it will,” said the old timer.\n\nThe young man took out his knife, cut the notch, stood up, drew his gun in a blur, and then shot a cufflink off the piano player. “Wow!” exclaimed the cowboy. “I'm learnin' somethin' here. Got any more tips?”\nThe old man pointed to a large can in a corner of the saloon. “See that axle grease over there? Coat your gun with it.” The young man went over to the can and smeared some of the grease on the barrel of his gun.\n\n“No,” said the old timer, “I mean, smear it all over the gun, handle and all.”\n“Will that make me a better gunfighter?” asked the young man.\n\n“No,” said the old timer, “but when Wyatt Earp gets done playing the piano, he's gonna shove that gun up your ass and it won't hurt as much.”",ai,ai_8296,0,0,1,1721,1721,319,4.394984326018808,25

It had been reported several times for housing a suspicious number of fans. (a Code 182).

Frankly, it was terrifying, but our nerves were steeled from years of spy training. Remaining calm we stayed hidden under the blankets gathering intel. But suddenly, from out of nowhere, I could hear my partner shout in horror and run past my hiding spot towards the store’s exit. I feared the worst. Was he okay? Had a fan discovered his location?

The bishop decided that he \nwould conduct the interviews personally and went up into \nthe belfry to begin the screening process. After \nobserving several applicants demonstrate their skills, \nhe decided to call it a day when a lone, armless man \napproached him and announced that he was there to apply\nfor the bellringer's job. The bishop was incredulous.\n\""You have no arms!\""\n\""No matter,\"" said the man, \""Observe!\""\nHe then began striking the bells with his face, producing \na beautiful melody on the carillon. The bishop listened \nin astonishment, convinced that he had finally found a \nsuitable replacement for Quasimodo. Suddenly, rushing \nforward to strike a bell, the armless man tripped, and \nplunged headlong out of the belfry window to his death \nin the street below. The stunned bishop rushed to his side.\nWhen he reached the street, a crowd had gathered around \nthe fallen figure, drawn by the beautiful music they had \nheard only moments before. As they silently parted to \nlet the bishop through, one of them asked,\n\""Bishop, do you know who this man is?\""\n\""I'm not sure\"", the Bishop replied, \""but his face sure rings a bell.\""",ai,ai_3481,0,0,1,1336,1336,211,5.331753554502369,11

"'Economic Stimulus' payment

Sometime this year, we taxpayers will again receive another 'Economic Stimulus' payment. \n\nThis is indeed a very exciting program, and I'll explain it by\nusing a Q & A format:\n \n \nQ. What is an 'Economic Stimulus' payment ?\n \nA. It is money that the federal government will send to taxpayers.\n \n \nQ.. Where will the government get this money ?\n \nA. From taxpayers.\n \n \nQ. So the government is giving me back my own money ?\n \nA. Only a smidgen of it.\n \n \nQ. What is the purpose of this payment ?\n \nA. The plan is for you to use the money to purchase a\nhigh-definition TV set, thus stimulating the economy.\n \n \nQ. But isn't that stimulating the economy of China ?\n \nA. Shut up.\n \n \nBelow is some helpful advice on how to best help the U.S. economy by spending your stimulus check wisely: \n \n \n \n* If you spend the stimulus money at Wal-Mart, the money will go to China or Sri Lanka .\n \n \n* If you spend it on gasoline, your money will go to the\nArabs.\n \n \n* If you purchase a computer, it will go to India , Taiwan or China . \n \n \n \n* If you purchase fruit and vegetables, it will go to Mexico ,\nHonduras and Guatemala ...\n \n \n \n* If you buy an efficient car, it will go to Japan or Korea .\n\n\n \n* If you purchase useless stuff, it will go to Taiwan .\n \n \n \n* If you pay your credit cards off, or buy stock, it will go\nto management bonuses and they will hide it offshore.\n \n \nInstead, keep the money in America by:\n \n \n1) Spending it at yard sales, or \n \n2) Going to ball games, or \n \n3) Spending it on prostitutes, or \n \n4) Beer or \n \n5) Tattoos.\n \n \n(These are the only American businesses still operating in the U.S. )\n\n\nConclusion:\n \nGo to a ball game with a tattooed prostitute that you met at a yard\nsale and drink beer all day !\n\n\nNo need to thank me, I'm just glad I could be of help.",ai,ai_9081,0,0,1,1906,1906,356,4.353932584269663,29

A lonely man decides he's going to obtain a lady of the night to have company for the evening.

As he's eyeing his glass, a woman approaches him.\n\n\""Hey good looking, if you take me home I'll give you the most amazing head you ever had.\""\n\nThe woman is gorgeous, so he agrees.\n\nThey head back to his place and she tells him the fee which is quite high.\n\n\""Just so you know, while I give you head I will sing you an opera song.

"Old School Pirate Crime

Captain Normal Beard the up-and-coming pirate captain and his first mate Clumsy Edward were in desperate need of ink in order to make the numerous treasure maps they were sure create during all of their treasure-filled journeys. More than anything they needed red ink for the illustrious X's that will mark the location of the unbound riches of their future. A well known calligrapher lived in the area and Clumsy Edward knew just how to get their much-needed red ink! \n \""Put ye hands out and I can vault into the window he keeps open, Cap'n. In an out real quick-like, sir! Ink an everything!\"" \n Clumsy Edward's plan was foolproof. The night had come and Captain Normal Beard and Clumsy Edward were outside the calligrapher's home. All according to plan, the window the duo had planned to use was open and the home was dark. Normal Beard interlocked his fingers as if he'd done it hundreds of times before and Edward was in the window in no time. \n Here's where the issue arises. \n Clumsy Edward, claiming his name once again, had only put enough forethought into the operation to get into the window. He was unaware of the layout of the small one-room home the calligrapher lived in. He was incredibly unaware that the calligrapher did all of his work right under the window and that he had neglected to put away his work from earlier the night. Clumsy Edward falls through the window and lands onto the table with a loud crash, alerting the neighboring citizens. \""Argh, I done crash't into the table an spill't the ink, Cap'n! I'm cover't innit!\""\nUpon hearing the commotion a nearby group of men ran to the scene to find Clumsy Edward leaving the home covered in ink. Black ink on his face. Blue across his entire torso. Red ink covering his arms and hands. \nUnfortunately, Clumsy Edward and Captain Normal Beard's dream to be wealthy pirates was known to the community and no one believed that Clumsy Edward would do something of his own fruition. \nAfter the fallout of their plan, Captain Normal Beard went to the local tavern to attempt to drown his sorrows unaware of the fate that befell his matey. \n Mid-drink Clumsy Edward was thrown into the tavern followed by his captors. Upon making eye contact with his Captain, Edward immediately and profusely apologized. Seeing this, Edward's captors seized Captain Normal Beard and showed him the evidence against him. The black ink on Edward's face. The Blue in across his torso. And finally, the red ink covering his arms and hands. \""We believe Edward here to have broken into the calligrapher's home with your instruction, Normal Beard. What do ye say to these accusations?\"" \n Captain Normal Beard was completely stunned, unable to come up with a good reason for their predicament. \nNormal Beard knew that he and his matey had been caught and they would surely hang for destruction and theft. His dream of becoming a pirate was over before it started to come to fruition. Being a man of his word, never lying, yet still sour over the outcome of the night said but one thing to the men.. \n \""Aye, we did the deed.. An I woulda got away wit it too, had ye not caught me Red Hand Ed!\"" \n\n\n\n\n **EDIT:** \nFirst post, long time redditor. I was unaware as to how long this would be. I just thought of the punchline and came up with a story on the fly. I hope at least one person gets a chuckle out of it, although I doubt it warrants a laugh or a bellow with how lengthy it is and how weak the punch is. Nevertheless, hope someone enjoys it and ANY criticism is more than welcomed. I have aspirations to possibly become a stand up comic, but of course not with jokes like this seeing as how it is far from suited for that kind of venue. Any way to shorten this joke is also extremely welcome. More so than any criticism, whether it be constructive or not. \n\n\n *Post Edit TL;DR* \nA pirate captain, Normal Beard, and his matey, Clumsy Edward, attempt to steal ink to make treasure maps. They break into a calligrapher's home with the matey clumsily falling and getting covered in ink, in particular, red ink on his arms and hands. The matey is caught and brought to the pirate captain by his captors who then interrogate the captain of his suspected crimes, bringing up the ink on his cohorts arms and hands. Being a man who doesn't lie, yet is still flustered the captain proclaims, \""\""Aye, we did the deed.. An I woulda got away wit it too, had ye not caught me Red Hand Ed!\"" \n\n\n *Post Edit TL;DR Edit* \nIt seems I just shortened my joke for myself... Which version do you like better?

I was immediately attracted to this shiny red drum kit. I had always had dreams of being a rock star and here was a chance to indulge my fantasies. It was also shiny and red. Oh, and the price was only $10. So I inquired about purchasing the set.\n\n---\n\n\""For $10, I'll take this monstrosity and you won't need to worry about finding a place to keep it anymore.\""\n\n\""Are you kidding?\""\n\n\""No, I'll give you $10 right now and take it away immediately.\""\n\n\""Are you sure you know what you're doing?\""\n\n\""Yes, I'm purchasing a shiny red drum set.\""\n\n\""But this drum set is cursed.\""\n\n\""Cursed, you say?\""\n\n\""Yes, cursed.\""\n\n\""Are you interested in selling it or not?\""\n\n\""Well, I guess I just want to get rid of it. But my conscience would never be at rest if I thought I had forced someone to take these drums.\""\n\n\""They're shiny and red and I want them.\""\n\n\""Well then, I guess you can have them.\""\n\n---\n\nIgnoring the warning, I went ahead and packed up the whole set and proceeded to bring them home. On the drive, I couldn't help but keep looking back at them with all of their shiny redness. I guess I must have been a little distracted and wasn't paying attention to where I was driving. Which is why I parked in my neighbors driveway. He seemed a slight bit upset about that.\n\nAfter finding my own driveway, I proceeded to unpack the drums and assemble them. There was a kick drum, a snare, three toms, a hi-hat and a ride cymbal. As I placed them, I couldn't help but notice my reflection upon the shiny red surface. I stood and admired their beauty.\n\nThe next day, I thought that I should try playing the drums. It was then that I noticed that I didn't have any drumsticks. So I looked around to see if I had anything that might resemble a drumstick. The best I could manage was some extra chopsticks from my favorite restaurant, \""The Red Dragon.\"" I knew it wasn't exactly the same, but at least the color matched. I stood behind the drums and started to give it a try.\n\nNow, my neighbor must have very sensitive hearing, because not long after I started, he arrived upon my doorstep, complaining about all the racket.\n\n---\n\n\""What are you doing?\""\n\n\""Yesterday, I bought a shiny red drum set and today I was overcome with the desire to try and play them.\""\n\n\""Well, I happen to be a well-trained musician and I can tell you now, that those drums sound terrible. I have perfect pitch and I tell you that they are completely out of tune.\""\n\n\""Really? I had no idea drums could be out of tune, but I guess I'll take your word for it.\""\n\n---\n\nHe then proceeded over to the drums and gave them a look all over. I could see his reflection upon the shiny surface as he surveyed the whole of them. After a few minutes, he proceeded to gather up the whole lot and walked out the door with them. Anxious to not see my dreams disappear, I immediately set to follow him.\n\nAs I exited the house, I saw him taking a good, measured wind up and then he proceeded to demonstrate his perfect pitch. He got the whole set squarely in the dumpster on the first try.",ai,ai_3437,0,0,1,3137,3137,554,4.662454873646209,40

"The Mexican president has a rare cancer of the brain and is in need of a brain transplant. His only option is a risky new procedure that his doctor recently perfected.

He now has to “shop” for his brain. \n\n“Sir, as this is a new procedure, our pool of brains you can choose from is rather small. Prices of the brains will vary,” said the doctor. \n\n“Okay, show me what you’ve got. I have an important job, so I’ll need the best brain,” replies the president. \n\n“A South Korean brain will cost you $80,000.” \n\nThe Mexican president widens his eyes in shock at the price. But then thinks that yes, the Koreans are smart people. It is quite understandable that a brain from there would be costly. \n\n“A brain from China would cost $15.000,” the doc continued, “an American one would cost $2,500, and las-“\n\n“HAH!” The president interrupted. “And those dumb Americans are always looking down on us. Look at their cheap ass brains!” The Mexican president smirks to himself. \n\n“As I was saying,” continued the doctor, “ lastly, a Mexican brain would cost $150,000.”\n\nImmediately, the president’s chest swells with pride, thinking what great minds his country has. \n\n“I’ll take the Mexican brain!” He exclaims, almost with a tear in his eye. \n\nAfter the operation, when the president is recovering, he begins to wonder and asks how the brains were priced. \n\n“Ah, you see, China has no shortage of brains from people getting terminated for unknown reasons. However, censorship and propaganda limits and degrades the brain somewhat. Hence the lower price. The Americans gorge their minds on social media, low quality entertainment and useless things like conspiracy theories. This combination really harms their brains, and the nonsense their president spouts also exacerbates this,” the doc adds with a slight smile. \n\n“What about Mexican brains? They’re the most expensive and therefore the best, right?” \n\n“Yes. They are the freshest minds with the most potential because most of them have never been used and are good as new.”",ai,ai_2615,0,0,1,2046,2046,336,5.089285714285714,27

"The tale of Louise.

Once upon a time there was a 7-year-old girl named Louise. Now from a young age Louise had always had an interest in science. Someday she wanted to be an astronaut, to pilot a spaceship, and to explore alien worlds, but she didn't have time for any of those things. You see, Louise's family owned this farm, and any time Louise wanted to, say, build a model spaceship or ""plot her Mars base"" (complete with a room that was filled with kitty cats!), as she would often do, her father would say ""Sorry, Louise, there's manure to scoop."" and she would have to go and shovel manure. So Louise would go and she'd shovel the manure. Louise had a secret, however. She had discovered this secret the day after her older sister moved out. One of the walls in her room could slide back to reveal a hidden room. Inside this room she kept all her ""space gear"": space goggles, a map of the solar system, a series of stories she wrote about this alien race she made up and all the hell that would break loose when humans encounter them. Today was Louise's 14th birthday, and she was tired of shoveling manure. Louise wanted nothing more than to finally speak her mind. She wanted to become a scientist, not work on some farm for the rest of her life. Her parents were eventually persuaded. When she was 18 she left and went to college, got a master's degree in astrophysics, and got a job at NASA. Louise eventually met a fantastic man named Matt and they fell in love. Within three years they were married and they had one child, a girl named Cassie. Cassie was also interested in science and, of course, her parents were far more allowing of that than Louise's had been. But all was not perfect. Matt, unfortunately, was killed in a car crash when Cassie was 10. Louise did her best to raise her child on her own. Cassie went on to discover a strange new species of rabbit found deep underground. They were quite intelligent, and they could breathe without needing oxygen. Cassie had the idea that these rabbits could be used to explore Mars. And soon, Mike and Jake, two space rabbits, were sent out on a mission to Mars. Mike and Jake, while piloting the spaceship, discovered that there was a stowaway on their ship. Who could it be? They looked around. Then they searched some more. The stowaway was hard to find, but eventually they found him, a rabbit named Kevin. Now Kevin was very annoying, and he annoyed the crap out of Mike and Jake while they tried to make it to Mars. Still, there was nothing the two NASA rabbits could do, they were pretty close to approaching Mars and their best option was just to go with it. So the three space rabbits landed on Mars eventually. Mike was excited, Jake was kinda scared, and Kevin had resorted to singing ""1000 bottles of beer on the wall"". They wandered around the planet rather aimlessly for a while, with nothing to really report. They traveled and traveled and traveled and it seemed like they had been there for an eternity. Eventually, the rabbits heard a strange noise with their large rabbit ears. *thump thump thump thump thump* They wondered what that noise could be and started to make their way towards it. Eventually the sound grew louder. *THUMP THUMP THUMP* And eventually it sounded like... a beat? Music perhaps? *T H U M P T H U M P T H U M P T H U M P* And... they saw it. A silhouette over the horizon. It looked like a rock. No, it was a house. A house? On Mars? Kevin was still annoying as ever and now down to ""4 bottles of beer on the wall"". They traveled closer to the house. It was definitely a house. A giant mansion of a house. And it was packed to the brim with martians having a party of some sort. There were martians in the pool, martians on the roof, martians dead on the pavement. The space rabbits were hungry after their long trip and decided to grab some pizza at this party. But the line to get the pizza was RIDICULOUSLY long. It went upstairs, downstairs again, out the door and around the house at least five times. They gave up on getting pizza. What rabbits eat pizza anyways? So they decided to get some snacks. Chips, pretzels, and the like. But this line was even longer. It went upstairs, downstairs again, out the door and around the house at least ten times. The rabbits were famished and parched. Then, they saw it. They saw it at last. Adventurous Louise, spirited Cassie, and obnoxious Kevin had all led up to this moment. This moment when they could be the first rabbits to set foot on Mars, and, while on Mars consume a fruity drink. Do you know why? Well, there was no punch line. ^^sorry",human,7bbblu,19,1510034673,0,4603,4603,853,4.396248534583822,66

"So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can’t believe his eyes...

There, in the corner, there’s this one\\-foot\\-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”\n\nSo the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with *geese*.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve\\-inch *pianist*?”\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve\\-inch penis?”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”\n\nAnd the guy’s, like, “World peace.”\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”\n\nAnd the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”\n\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve\\-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve\\-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”\n\nAnd the twelve\\-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”\n\nAnd all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat\\-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”\n\nAnd the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve\\-inch *pianist*?”\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean *that*.”\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.\n\nSo the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”\n\nAnd the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Well done.”\n\nAnd then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one\\-foot\\-tall boyfriend.”\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”\n\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.”",ai,ai_3910,0,0,1,6120,6120,1038,4.895953757225434,98

My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.” And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?” And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.” So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.” And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey. And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.” And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.” And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!” And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .” And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.” And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears! And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!” And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.” And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?” And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.” And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal. And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey. And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.” And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.” And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.” And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!” And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms. And suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping. And the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.” And the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!” And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.” And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips. So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie. So the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.” And the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other. And the guy’s, like, “Well done.” And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.” And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment. And the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.” And the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.”",human,cnb7lo,11,1565209866,0,5970,5970,1094,4.457038391224863,99

"Timely hurricane advice

All week you're going to turn on the TV and see a weather person pointing to some radar blob out in the Atlantic and making two basic meteorological points:\n\n(1) There is no need to panic.\n(2) We could all be killed.\n\nYes, hurricane season is an exciting time to be in South Carolina. If you're new to the area, you're probably wondering what you need to do to prepare for the possibility that we'll get hit by \""the big one.\""\nBased on experience, we recommend that you follow this simple three-step hurricane preparedness plan:\n\nSTEP 1. Buy enough food, beer, and bottled water to last your family for at least three days.\nSTEP 2. Put these supplies into your car.\nSTEP 3. Drive to Nebraska and remain there until Halloween.\n\nUnfortunately, statistics show that most people will not follow this sensible plan. Most people will foolishly stay here in South Carolina.\nWe'll start with one of the most important hurricane preparedness items:\n\nHOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE: If you own a home, you must have hurricane insurance.\nFortunately, this insurance is cheap and easy to get, as long as your home meets two basic requirements:\n(1) It is reasonably well-built, and\n(2) It is located in Nebraska.\nUnfortunately, if your home is located in South Carolina, or any other area that might actually be hit by a hurricane, most insurance companies would prefer not to sell you hurricane insurance, because then they might be required to pay YOU money, and that is certainly not why they got into the insurance business in the first place. So you'll have to scrounge around for an insurance company, which will charge you an annual premium roughly equal to the replacement value of your house. At any moment, this company can drop you like used dental floss. Since Hurricane George, I have had an estimated 27 different home-insurance companies.\nThis week, I'm covered by the Bob and Big Stan Insurance Company, under a policy which states that, in addition to my premium, Bob and Big Stan are entitled, on demand, to my kidneys.\n\nSHUTTERS: Your house should have hurricane shutters on all the windows, all the doors, and -- if it's a major hurricane -- all the toilets. There are several types of shutters, with advantages and disadvantages:\nPlywood shutters: The advantage is that, because you make them yourself, they're cheap. The disadvantage is that, because you make them yourself, they will fall off.\nSheet-metal shutters: The advantage is that these work well, once you get them all up. The disadvantage is that once you get them all up, your hands will be useless bleeding stumps, and it will be December.\nRoll-down shutters: The advantages are that they're very easy to use, and will definitely protect your house. The disadvantage is that you will have to sell your house to pay for them.\nHurricane-proof windows: These are the newest wrinkle in hurricane protection: They look like ordinary windows, but they can withstand hurricane winds! You can be sure of this, because the salesman says so. He lives in Nebraska.\nHurricane Proofing Your Property: As the hurricane approaches, check your yard for movable objects like barbecue grills, planters, patio furniture, visiting relatives, etc.. You should, as a precaution, throw these items into your swimming pool (if you don't have a swimming pool, you should have one built immediately). Otherwise, the hurricane winds will turn these objects into deadly missiles.\n\nEVACUATION ROUTE: If you live in a low-lying area, you should have an evacuation route planned out. (To determine whether you live in a low-lying area, look at your driver's license; if it says \""South Carolina,\"" you live in a low-lying area.) The purpose of having an evacuation route is to avoid being trapped in your home when a major storm hits.\nInstead, you will be trapped in a gigantic traffic jam several miles from your home, along with two hundred thousand other evacuees. So, as a bonus, you will not be lonely.\n\nHURRICANE SUPPLIES: If you don't evacuate, you will need a mess of supplies.\nDo not buy them now! South Carolina tradition requires that you wait until the last possible minute, then go to the supermarket and get into vicious fights with strangers over who gets the last can of SPAM.\nIn addition to food and water, you will need the following supplies:\n23 flashlights and at least $167 worth of batteries that turn out, when the power goes off, to be the wrong size for the flashlights.\nBleach. (No, I don't know what the bleach is for. NOBODY knows what the bleach is for, but it's traditional, so GET some!)\nA 55-gallon drum of underarm deodorant.\nA big knife that you can strap to your leg. (This will be useless in a hurricane, but it looks cool.)\nA large quantity of raw chicken, to placate the alligators. (Ask anybody who went through Hugo. After the hurricane, there WILL be irate alligators.)\n$35,000 in cash or diamonds so that, after the hurricane passes, you can buy a generator from a man with no discernible teeth.\nOf course these are just basic precautions. As the hurricane draws near, it is vitally important that you keep abreast of the situation by turning on your television and watching TV reporters in rain slickers stand right next to the ocean and tell you over and over how vitally important it is for everybody to stay away from the ocean.\nGood luck, and remember: It's great living in Paradise.\n\n(Edit: substitute the hurricane-prone state of your choice for S Carolina. Or substitute whatever natural disaster applies to your area that your insurance company tries to get out of paying for. )",ai,ai_5264,0,0,1,5630,5630,918,5.132897603485839,54

"A dalmatian is very confused.

He doesn't know if he's a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots. He is asking his friends to see if they can help him. He goes to Squirrel and asks ""Squirrel, am I a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots?"" The squirrel looks up to him and says in her squirrely voice ""That's a good question, I don't know."" The dalmatian then approaches his friend the cat and asks him the same question: ""Cat, am I a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots?"" The cat responds, ""Beats me"" and walks away. The dalmatian is walking down the street contemplating his conundrum and is wondering if there is anyone else he can ask, when BAM he gets hit by a truck and dies. He goes to Doggy Heaven and is greeted by Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates. Peter welcomes the dog to Heaven and gives him a quick overview of the place. He finishes and asks if Dalmatian has any questions. ""Yes!"" the dalmatian said excitedly. ""This question has been bothering me for the longest time and I need to know. Am I a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots?"" Saint Peter quizzically looks up as he thinks, then shakes his head as he replies, ""I don't know. BUT, what you can do is go in and ask the big guy yourself. Go down this hall and he's at the very last door."" ""Wow thanks!"" says Dalmatian. He gets to the last room, knocks and enters. God asks how he can help. The dalmatian timidly asks his question: ""Am I a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots?"" Without missing a beat, God responds in a booming voice, ""You are what you are."" Satisfied, the dog leaves. Upon exiting, Saint Peter asks, ""Well, did you get your answer?"" ""Yes I did!"" the dalmatian says with confidence. ""God said 'You are what you are', that means I am a white dog with black spots. If I was a black dog with white spots, God would have said 'You is what you is.""",human,3zqp4g,2,1452100119,0,1935,1935,375,4.16,23

A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried.

"A store that sells new husbands has opened in New York City, where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building! So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs. She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads: Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids. 'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.' So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads: Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking. 'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework. 'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!' Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak. She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads: Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. Naturally some bright spark opens A New Wives store. Floor 1 - Has wives that love sex. Floor 2 - Has wives that love sex, have money and like beer. The remaining floors have never been visited. It just goes to show that men are easier to please.",human,axetj3,5,1551746801,0,1811,1811,343,4.279883381924198,20

So there was a guy at a bar drinking and minding his own business. Suddenly, a man walks in carrying a very large duffel bag.

A few moments later he re-emerged from the bag with a smaller (proportionately sized) piano, and began to play it. Curious, the first guy asks ""What's the story behind this guy?"" ""Well,"" the second guy says as he reaches into the bag. ""I found this in the woods the other day"" he said as he pulled a lamp of sorts from the bag. He said ""It houses a genie who will grant anybody just one wish! JBe sure to speak clearly though because he is a little hard of hearing."" The first guy, not taking him seriously spouts out ""Well then I wish for a million bucks."" All of the sudden, the bar is instantly *filled* with ducks, ducks everywhere.

Paddy and his long time friend Shamus finally scored a job at Heathrow airport as tarmac broom operators. Problem was it was night shift and it was seriously cutting into their drinking habits.\nThat was until a Concorde landed and was taxied over to where they were working, and obviously Paddy had to go have a look and ended up under the wings. \nHe called Shamus over after he noticed a slight smell and a dripping noise, Paddy ended up tracking it down to a leaking fuel tank and stood directly under the drip hoping to catch a bit in his hand. \nBut Shamus took that exact moment to nudge him and Paddy got a big splash right onto his tongue. To say it caught him by surprise was like saying the Irish don’t drink.\nShamus was shocked when Paddy screwed up his face and turned a horrible shade of white, ‘Begorrah that’s got a kick like a mule!’ Yelled Paddy.\nWell Shamus not to be outdone grabbed the mop bucket nearby and waited patiently until it had a few millimetres inside and skulled the precious fluid. He immediately tried to bring his hands up to his neck as his throat constricted but found them forced back by some invisible force. \nAnd that was the last thing he remembered, waking up the next day in a hospital bed with drips coming out of arm.

"The Medicrin Story - taken from a Boy Scouting website

Long ago, before Gamecubes, before Playstations, even before Atari, there were nasty, vile monsters roaming the land. In those days, a few brave, strong men made their living by protecting common people from these beasts. This is a story about one such man named Erik and the adventure he had. \n\nThere was a small village on the edge of a wide prairie, next to a very thick forest that led up into the cold, dark mountains. In these mountains lived the dreaded Medicrin. The Medicrin would stalk down from the mountains in the dead of night, sneak into the village, and snatch a sleeping villager. He would take the poor soul away and eat him for breakfast. This happened every week so you can imagine the villagers became quite tired of it. \n\nThe terrified villagers called a meeting, and decided to hire the greatest hero around - Erik the Brave! \n\nErik rode into town on his trusty steed, entered the city hall, and listened to the story the villagers told of the monster that attacked at night each week. When they were finished, Erik told them he would have a plan in the morning and he went to his hotel room. \n\nIn his room, he consulted his Great Hero's Book of Vile Monsters, and found the chapter about the Medicrin. He learned that Medicrins stink like rotten eggs. He learned they have 6 fingers with long claws. He learned they never brush their teeth. He learned they have very good noses. And he learned they love to eat human flesh, but even more, they love to eat Loons. \n\nSo, early the next morning, actually very, very early the next morning, Erik hunted high and low, near and far, to find a loon. He finally found one just before breakfast, captured it, tied it up, and brought it back to the village. He then told the villagers his plan. \nHe had them dig a pit that was 20 feet deep (because the Medicrin was 9 feet tall) and 10 feet around. While they were digging, Erik tied a big rock to the leg of the loon, so it could not fly away. \nWhen the pit was finished, just about a half hour before sunset, Erik tossed in the rock, and of course the loon went in too. Then, he told the villagers to go to their homes while he waited for the Medicrin. \nErik jumped in the bushes and waited with his great broadsword with which to slay the Medicrin. \n\nThat night, the Medicrin snuck into the village . . . \nIt smelled the loon . . . \nIt came closer to the pit . . . \nBut then it smelled DANGER, and it ran off. On the way out of the village, it grabbed one of the villagers for a snack. \n\nNeedless to say, the villagers were not happy. Some demanded their money back, others wanted to throw Erik into the pit. After calming the villagers, the next day, Erik again consulted his Great Hero's Book of Vile Monsters, and learned more about the Medicrin. He learned it wore the same underwear for 3 weeks in a row. He learned it could not sing at all, but enjoyed listening to opera music. But, most importantly, he learned that Medicrins love sugar more than anything else in the world, even turnip-spinach surprise! \n\nSo, Erik used some of the money the villagers had given him and rode his trusty steed to the next village, bought all the sugar he could carry and returned - this took two days because villages were far apart in those days. The next day, he rode to a different village and bought their sugar. The next day, he went to yet another village. It had now been a week and the Medicrin was due to come again this night. \nErik gathered all this sugar and threw it into the pit. The loon, that was still stuck down in the pit, had not eaten in a week now and was extremely hungry. As fast as Erik could throw the sugar in the pit, the loon ate it up. It ate ALL the sugar! \n\nErik was struck with panic, and ran to and fro trying to figure out what to do next, but night had fallen, and the Medicrin would be there soon, so Erik crossed his fingers, and hoped for the best. \n\nThat night, the Medicrin came . . . \nIt smelled the loon . . . \nIt came closer to the pit . . . \nIt smelled sugar . . . \nIt came closer to the pit . . . \nIt smelled DANGER and turned to run away. \nBut, that smell of sugar was just too overpowering. \nIt couldn't resist. \nThe Medicrin ran up and dove down into the pit. \nAnd, it was trapped! \nBrave Erik leaped from behind the bush, raised his sword, and jumped down onto the Medicrin, driving his sword into its neck, and slew it. \n\nWhich just goes to show: A loon full of sugar helps the Medicrin go down.",ai,ai_3746,0,0,1,4549,4549,857,4.308051341890315,69

I'm wearing the boxers with the little hearts all over them tonight.... It's probably not a good night to go to jail. Getting married at 22 sounds a lot like leaving a party at 9:30pm.

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost. I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone, the hearse nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left, and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play. The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I've never played before for this homeless man. And as I played 'Amazing Grace,' the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept; we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car.

"The daughter of a melon farmer and a travelling musician met one day and fell in love at first sight

The woman’s name was Angie, a beautiful, red-haired woman with a smile so magnetic and radiant one couldn’t help but fall head-over-heels; the musician’s name was Zachary, a strapping, young lad with flowing, blonde hair and broad shoulders, just wide enough to give him a powerful physique yet not intimidating in the slightest. The two had met in a bar on a clear, starry night in the middle of July. The second Zachary had stepped in his gaze immediately met Angie’s. He approached her without a thought as to what he would say and had taken a seat mere inches from her. She turned to him, a gleam in her eyes as she introduced herself. “Good evening, the name’s Angie. How are you tonight?” A faint seductiveness in her voice sent a tingle down Zachary’s spine as he hurried. “Lovely weather we’re having, isn’t it?” Now, Zachary was always a fairly shy man. Despite his appearance he was never one for starting conversation and his fear was only elevated even more by the fact that Angie was by far the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. The two talked some more throughout the night and eventually grew comfortable with one another. Despite her lifestyle Angie’s favourite genre of music had turned out to be soft-rock, which lo and behold Zachary was an artist in. “Why don’t you come to my concert? I’m playing tomorrow night at the theatre south of town and I’d love to have you there with me.” Angie had sprung on the offer, not wasting a second as she accepted with a great deal of enthusiasm. She gave him her address and phone number with a small note written on the bottom right: “pick me up at 10” with a heart drawn right next to it. The next night Angie had waited for her parents to go to bed before going out to wait at her door for Zachary. Luckily, he’d arrived in the nick of time. “I’m on in an hour. If we hurry we can make it about 10 minutes early.” Once the two had arrived Zachary led Angie backstage, telling her to wait for his call in order to find the best seat in the theatre to watch him play. Not five minutes passed once her phone buzzed, with the message “there’s a seat right in front of the mic stand, I got the set-up crew to reserve it for you.” Once the concert had begun Zachary stepped up to the mic and looked right into Angie’s eyes while saying “this first song goes out to the most amazing woman I’ve ever had the chance of meeting.” Throughout the concert Angie’s eyes were glued to Zachary. She could feel herself falling deeper and deeper in love with him as he played, her beautiful, green eyes still stuck to his image long after the final song had been played. Once backstage Angie had rushed toward her lover, locking lips with him and holding him as close to her as she could. Once the kiss had broken she jumped in place ecstatically, screaming in joy “that was the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen, Zachary! You were incredible out there!” The drummer could be heard from the snack table, “I’m here, too, you know,” but to no avail. Zachary led Angie to the side where he held her hands and gazed deeply into her eyes, and said to her: “Angie, I can’t stay here forever. I’m always travelling and I can’t just leave my life behind.” Angie’s eyes welled up as she fought to choke back tears. “Please, don’t cry. We can work around that.” “How?” Whispered Angie, her throat still sore from crying. “Come with me! We can travel the world together! You can leave this old melon business behind and we could be together!” “I...” Angie said to herself. “What is it?” “I don’t think that’s possible.” “Why not?” Now Zachary was starting to cry. “My father would never approve of it. He wants me to become a farmer just like him to keep the family business running.” “Angie, please,” begged Zachary. “I love you so much! I don’t want to leave you behind!” “I’m sorry, my dear,” cried Angie, wiping the tears from her cheek. “I cantaloupe.”",human,8jhg0m,6,1526345446,0,3996,3996,735,4.436734693877551,41

"Don't Fart In Bed

This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years. The only friction in their marriage was the husband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke. The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor. She was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, ""Honey, you were right. All these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you. ""What do you mean?"" asked his wife. ""Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and these two fingers, I think I got most of them back in!",human,71x57p,280,1506155069,0,1925,1925,363,4.303030303030303,18

"Answered Prayer

The pastor asked if anyone in the congregation would like to express praise for answered prayers. Suzie Smith stood and walked to the podium. She said, ""I have a praise. Two months ago, my husband, Phil, had a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed. The pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him."" You could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagined the pain that poor Phil must have experienced. ""Phil was unable to hold me or the children,"" she went on, ""and every move caused him terrible pain. We prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of Phil's scrotum and wrap wire around it to hold it in place."" Again, the men in the congregation cringed and squirmed uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on Phil. ""Now,"" she announced in a quivering voice, ""thank the Lord, Phil is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time his scrotum should recover completely."" All the men sighed with unified relief. The pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say. A man stood up and walked slowly to the podium. He said, ""I'm Phil."" The entire congregation held its breath. ""I just want to tell my wife the word is sternum.""",human,4091yv,455,1452387164,0,1355,1355,238,4.69327731092437,17

"A wonderful homemade pun (VERY Long)

I decided not to add a TL;DR. If you've ever read the longest joke in the world, I'm guessing this might be right up near it, and might have the same effect. To get the full effect, I strongly reccomend you read the entire thing. Well, enough yapping, let's get started!\n\nSo there’s this guy, walking around somewhere in India. He looks about sixty, his hair is just starting to gray. He’s walking down this really dirty street, with trash and mud everywhere. Here’s his story.\n\nHis name is Abuk Chandrasekhar, but you can just call him Abuk. He is on his way home from a long, hard day at work. He’s about five minutes away from his tiny apartment. It is pouring down rain, the streets are nearly impossible to traverse across. After some struggle, Abuk is able to make it home safely. He takes off his dripping coat and muddy boots, then leans in close to his dingy kerosene heater. It’s no dinner again for the second night in a row; he’s about fed up with this hard life. But what can he do? If only he could somehow get to America, maybe life would be better.\n\nAbuk decides to sing away his troubles. Ever since he was a little boy, his mother and father encouraged him to sing. After twenty years of practice every night, he finally could sing beautifully, at least in his opinion. He has improved even more in the years after, and uses nearly all of his spare time to practice. Abuk falls asleep hours later, with dreams of singing in the far off land of America.\n\nThe next morning, the weather clears up. He goes on his way to work as happy as can be. Up ahead, he sees disturbance in the street. a billboard. It’s brightly colored with very crisp edges just beginning to peel off. It says “AMERICAN IDOL - COMING TO NEW YORK CITY” in bold, thick text. Abuk’s face lights up right away. It must be a sign. He now knows where his life is going! Abuk turns around, rushes home, goes to his room, and grabs the small envelope that holds his entire life savings. He finds his phone, and dials the number for the local airport.\n “Hello, you’ve reached the Chennai International Airport, how may I help you?” the operator says in Hindi.\n “Hello, I was wondering how much a flight to New York would cost me.”\n “Our next flight to New York leaves in three days, and the price is...\nHold on, let me check.... Fifty thousand rupees.”\n “Thank you” Abuk returns in English, hanging up the phone.\nAbuk counts his money. He has more than enough.\n “I’m going to America!” he exclaims ecstatically.\n\n\n\n\nTwo days later, at the Chennai International Airport\n0’600 hours\n\nAbuk steps out of the taxi, and pays the driver a generous tip. He hops out, grabs his bags, and happily jogs to the entrance. He quickly makes it through the light security, and heads directly for the plane. He tells everyone he can about his upcoming adventure to America. Most people keep walking without turning their heads, but at the gate Abuk meets someone who actually acknowledges him. The man who listens introduces himself as Aarav. He is traveling to America to meet his wife and child who flew up a few months earlier. He says he is the owner of a Jazz club, and invites Abuk to sing.\n “Oh, that sounds wonderful!” Abuk says, “After I finish the competition I will certainly come by to see you!”\n “Yes, very good, very good! I will see you later! May i have your phone number to call you?”\n “Sure, here.” Aarav pulls out his phone to write down the number. “91-365-447-3283.”\n “Thanks!” says Aarav.\n\n There is a buzz over the intercom, and the flight attendant starts announcing the first section. Abuk waves goodbye to his new acquaintance, and boards the plane. Abuk sits down right in the front of the plane so he can be the first one off. He stores his carry-on, and reclines his seat for the long, tiring flight ahead. Tomorrow he will be in America!\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, in New York City.\nNoon\n\n Abuk strolls down the sidewalk, looking for the address listed on the billboard. The Al Hirschfeld theater. It isn’t hard to find, there’s a gigantic line of people out front. Camera crews walk up and down the crowds, people fighting for a shot in the camera. The auditions have already started! Abuk sprints to the back of the line. It takes nearly three hours of watching cars zoom past, planes fly overhead, lights flash, and the other hustling and bustling of the city before he makes it to the front. The bouncer calls his name, and he steps inside. Sitting in front of him are three judges: Steven Tyler, Simon Cowell, and Jennifer Lopez.\n“Oh, oh my gods! It is an honor to meet you!” Abuk says. I flew in all the way from india, and I’m here!\n“Oh, India! How wonderful!” Jennifer Lopez says, “I visited India many years ago. You have a beautiful country.”\n“Thank you, thank you!” Abuk says, “Today I will be singing Respect by Aretha Franklin. It is one of my favorites!”\n“Mine too, let’s hear it!” Steven Tyler returns.\nAbuk sings a wonderful solo, and gets all three votes to pass. He is going to Hollywood! Abuk runs out of the theater onto the streets, fist pumping and jumping for joy. In just two weeks, he will be appearing live on television in front of a huge studio audience! It seems his dream is going to come true!\nDuring the next few weeks, Abuk transfers his rupees to dollars, catches a transfer flight to Hollywood, and makes it to the theater with time to spare. He smashes his first performance, and makes it onto the semi finals unanimously. He goes around Hollywood, seeing everything he can, and just taking in the overwhelming rush of joy. He catches ANOTHER plane to the semifinals, and rocks Never Gonna Give You Up by rick Astley. After a few more weeks, he’s sitting at the finals, with two other people he’s competing against. His turn comes up faster than he would believe, and he attempts to sing the hardest song he’s ever had. Although he’s been practicing since the semifinals, he still doesn’t know if he can pull it off. His cover of Take on Me by A-Ha may be his biggest challenge yet. He dances to the techno music at the beginning, awing the crowd with his great moves. When the first line comes however, he misses his mark. He’s off by two seconds. His voice cracks, and his face turns bright red with embarrassment. He asks them to restart the track, but it’s too late. His final challenge is ruined. He failed. Tears stream down his face as he looked around the room, the audience dead silent. He slowly walks off stage.\nThe next night, Abuk walks into the theater. The announcer comes on, and the three contestants line up.\n“The winner of American idol is... going to be announced after a quick commercial break.” The audience breaks out in laughter.\nFive minutes later, it happens for real.\n“America has voted.

"A man working at the Federal Reserve

A man working at the Federal Reserve was hired to manufacture pennies. On his first day, the supervisor walked him around the manufacturing area. “This first machine melts down large blocks of metal. The liquid metal is then poured into a mold that makes a smaller block. That smaller block is then taken off the conveyer belt by this control arm and placed on another conveyer belt. The conveyer belt rolls the smaller block into a machine that cuts the block into evenly-sized cubes. Those cubes are individually melted down again and poured into a mold with 25 slots that shape the tails side of the penny. Each penny is then stamped on the other side with the heads side, which completes the penny. All of the pennies are cooled, rolled, and stored for shipping. If you have no more questions, then come back tomorrow for your first day of work.” The next morning, the supervisor walks in to see a totally new machine melting metal and stamping pennies. Completely stunned, the supervisor runs up to the man who had just been hired yesterday as he was operating the new machine. Supervisor: “What’s going on? Where did the old machines go?” Man: “I borrowed a fork lift and pulled all of the old equipment to the garbage area. Then I brought the new equipment in and assembled it.” Supervisor: “How does this new machine even work?” Man: “First, the metal is all dropped into this furnace. The furnace is connected to a hopper that pours the liquid metal directly into these racks of molding trays. Each tray has exactly 50 slots that shape the tails side of the penny. Lastly, each penny is stamped with the heads design and moved into the cooling and rolling process.” Supervisor: “Well this is amazing. The new machine does seem to move faster than the old machine. Last question, why did you replace the old molding trays? The two trays appear identical, although the new trays have twice as many slots. Couldn’t we have just used the old trays? Man: “Sure we could have, but the new tray makes more cents.”",human,bmvsba,27,1557477252,0,2053,2053,364,4.6401098901098905,23

"The Medicrin Story - taken from a Boy Scouting website

Long ago, before Gamecubes, before Playstations, even before Atari, there were nasty, vile monsters roaming the land. In those days, a few brave, strong men made their living by protecting common people from these beasts. This is a story about one such man named Erik and the adventure he had. There was a small village on the edge of a wide prairie, next to a very thick forest that led up into the cold, dark mountains. In these mountains lived the dreaded Medicrin. The Medicrin would stalk down from the mountains in the dead of night, sneak into the village, and snatch a sleeping villager. He would take the poor soul away and eat him for breakfast. This happened every week so you can imagine the villagers became quite tired of it. The terrified villagers called a meeting, and decided to hire the greatest hero around - Erik the Brave! Erik rode into town on his trusty steed, entered the city hall, and listened to the story the villagers told of the monster that attacked at night each week. When they were finished, Erik told them he would have a plan in the morning and he went to his hotel room. In his room, he consulted his Great Hero's Book of Vile Monsters, and found the chapter about the Medicrin. He learned that Medicrins stink like rotten eggs. He learned they have 6 fingers with long claws. He learned they never brush their teeth. He learned they have very good noses. And he learned they love to eat human flesh, but even more, they love to eat Loons. So, early the next morning, actually very, very early the next morning, Erik hunted high and low, near and far, to find a loon. He finally found one just before breakfast, captured it, tied it up, and brought it back to the village. He then told the villagers his plan. He had them dig a pit that was 20 feet deep (because the Medicrin was 9 feet tall) and 10 feet around. While they were digging, Erik tied a big rock to the leg of the loon, so it could not fly away. When the pit was finished, just about a half hour before sunset, Erik tossed in the rock, and of course the loon went in too. Then, he told the villagers to go to their homes while he waited for the Medicrin. Erik jumped in the bushes and waited with his great broadsword with which to slay the Medicrin. That night, the Medicrin snuck into the village . . . It smelled the loon . . . It came closer to the pit . . . But then it smelled DANGER, and it ran off. On the way out of the village, it grabbed one of the villagers for a snack. Needless to say, the villagers were not happy. Some demanded their money back, others wanted to throw Erik into the pit. After calming the villagers, the next day, Erik again consulted his Great Hero's Book of Vile Monsters, and learned more about the Medicrin. He learned it wore the same underwear for 3 weeks in a row. He learned it could not sing at all, but enjoyed listening to opera music. But, most importantly, he learned that Medicrins love sugar more than anything else in the world, even turnip-spinach surprise! So, Erik used some of the money the villagers had given him and rode his trusty steed to the next village, bought all the sugar he could carry and returned - this took two days because villages were far apart in those days. The next day, he rode to a different village and bought their sugar. The next day, he went to yet another village. It had now been a week and the Medicrin was due to come again this night. Erik gathered all this sugar and threw it into the pit. The loon, that was still stuck down in the pit, had not eaten in a week now and was extremely hungry. As fast as Erik could throw the sugar in the pit, the loon ate it up. It ate ALL the sugar! Erik was struck with panic, and ran to and fro trying to figure out what to do next, but night had fallen, and the Medicrin would be there soon, so Erik crossed his fingers, and hoped for the best. That night, the Medicrin came . . . It smelled the loon . . . It came closer to the pit . . . It smelled sugar . . . It came closer to the pit . . . It smelled DANGER and turned to run away. But, that smell of sugar was just too overpowering. It couldn't resist. The Medicrin ran up and dove down into the pit. And, it was trapped! Brave Erik leaped from behind the bush, raised his sword, and jumped down onto the Medicrin, driving his sword into its neck, and slew it. Which just goes to show: A loon full of sugar helps the Medicrin go down.",human,8ya3sq,10,1531404683,0,4471,4471,857,4.217036172695449,69

"Tourists in Australia

George and Ethel retired, and decided to take a vacation in Australia and see the Outback. While driving through the Outback, they came over a hill, and on the side of the road was a bushman having sex with a kangaroo. George quickly shielded his wife's eyes while they drove by. A few miles later, they happen across another bushman, again, having sex with a kangaroo, and again, George has to cover Ethel's eyes as they drive past. The couple stops at a gas station further down the road, and George goes inside to use the bathroom. In the bathroom, George sees a guy with one leg, leaning against his crutches, masturbating furiously.

"Mordred's hidden power

King Arthur has lately been very fond of Morgause. News has it that she bore him a son which was named Mordred, not thinking about the repercussions it might bring to his kingdom. On the other hand, the G brothers (Morgause's sons to her husband Lot) weren't very fond of their mother's incest-begotten son. \n\nYeaes have passed, the brothers wanted to get rid of Mordred. However, it was very unhonorable for a knight to kill a boy who can't defend himself. The brothers then waited for Mordred to become a knight himself. When he became a full-fledged knight in service of King Arthur, the brothers came up with a plan. \n\nOne of them is to challenge Mordred to a duel, and would dismiss his death as an accident while sparring. The brothers agreed that this is a foolproof plan, as Mordred seemed weaker than any of them, but boy were they in for a surprise. \n\nIt was Gaheris who challenged him. After exchanging a couple of blows, it seemed like Mordred changed his weapon and armor in the blink of an eye, countering his arsenal. With this new weapon and armor, Gaheris knew that he can't possibly defeat Mordred now. \n\nAggravayne challenged him next, and the same thing happened during their battle. Mordred's armor and weapon changed in the middle of the battle, and his greatsword became useless. As he fell on his knees, he came up with a better plan. He warned his brothers about this power, and that they should challenge him 2 on 1.\n\nNo longer wanting to further taint their family's honor, Gawain and Gareth challenged Mordred 2 on 1 to get rid of him for good. They expected him turn down this challenge, but he obliged. They thought that they have the upper hand as there are two of them, but they underestimated Mordred's power. In less than a second, his armor hardened that not even a diamond can scratch it. Their swords broke as they clashed with Mordred's. Hopeless, the 2 of them surrendered and asked Mordred about his ability. \n\nMordred, with the most impish grin he can muster, simply told them:\n\n\""Does it ever drive you crazy just how fast the knight changes?\""",ai,ai_5485,0,0,1,2124,2124,371,4.725067385444744,23

"The Husband Store & The Wife Store

The Husband Store A store that sells new husbands has opened in New York City, where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates: You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but cannot go back down except to exit the building! So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs. She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads: Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids. ""That's nice,"" she thinks, ""but I want more."" So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads: Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking. ""Wow,"" she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads: Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework. ""Oh, mercy me!"" she exclaims, ""I can hardly stand it!"" Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop- dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak. She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads: Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. PLEASE NOTE: To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street. The first floor has wives that love sex. The second floor has wives that love sex and have money and like beer.

"Mordred's hidden power

King Arthur has lately been very fond of Morgause. News has it that she bore him a son which was named Mordred, not thinking about the repercussions it might bring to his kingdom. On the other hand, the G brothers (Morgause's sons to her husband Lot) weren't very fond of their mother's incest-begotten son. Yeaes have passed, the brothers wanted to get rid of Mordred. However, it was very unhonorable for a knight to kill a boy who can't defend himself. The brothers then waited for Mordred to become a knight himself. When he became a full-fledged knight in service of King Arthur, the brothers came up with a plan. One of them is to challenge Mordred to a duel, and would dismiss his death as an accident while sparring. The brothers agreed that this is a foolproof plan, as Mordred seemed weaker than any of them, but boy were they in for a surprise. It was Gaheris who challenged him. After exchanging a couple of blows, it seemed like Mordred changed his weapon and armor in the blink of an eye, countering his arsenal. With this new weapon and armor, Gaheris knew that he can't possibly defeat Mordred now. Aggravayne challenged him next, and the same thing happened during their battle. Mordred's armor and weapon changed in the middle of the battle, and his greatsword became useless. As he fell on his knees, he came up with a better plan. He warned his brothers about this power, and that they should challenge him 2 on 1. No longer wanting to further taint their family's honor, Gawain and Gareth challenged Mordred 2 on 1 to get rid of him for good. They expected him turn down this challenge, but he obliged. They thought that they have the upper hand as there are two of them, but they underestimated Mordred's power. In less than a second, his armor hardened that not even a diamond can scratch it. Their swords broke as they clashed with Mordred's. Hopeless, the 2 of them surrendered and asked Mordred about his ability. Mordred, with the most impish grin he can muster, simply told them: ""Does it ever drive you crazy just how fast the knight changes?""",human,6p0uv5,0,1500809688,0,2096,2096,373,4.619302949061662,23

"As I type this, I am slowly dying of cancer. This is my story, and I hope whoever reads this takes this as a warning.

I was never one of the cool kids. Ever since I was born I have been, if no better way to put it, average. My mother used to tell me the story of when I was born. Apparently, when I first popped out, I didn't cry, as one would expect a newborn baby to. I simply peered around a bit as the nurses rushed over to take care of me. How's that ""average""? I don't know. It's just a story my mom used to tell me, and I think it sets the stage rather well for what was to come. The days of my innocence flew by, and soon I was about to enter 9th grade. That was when my dad was posted to a new state by his company. Leaving behind my home of nearly 14 years, I stepped into the brave new world of Mississippi. Of course, that meant I enrolled in a new high school. There, lost and alone, I stumbled around until I met my two guys who would become the best friends I would ever have. To cut a long story short, I got to know them in math class. Bored by a particularly dry lecture (something about calculus) we struck a conversation and found that we shared a common interest: We were all crazy into gaming. We talked about the newest Metal Gear, and it all went uphill from there. Their names were Luke and Missile. Luke was a bit of a nerd, but an all-round cool guy, and an amazing friend. If you were in a jam, you could be sure Luke would be there to see you through. Missile, on the other hand, was a wild one; always on the move, and with such an excited and bubbly manner of speaking you could feel yourself getting carried along as he spoke. At first, I thought he was Latino, but turns out he was half-filipino. Oh, and his real name was Gonzales. He just liked being called ""Missile"" (for whatever reason, I do not know. I doubt even he himself really does). So it was with these two that I spent a happy 6 months in high school. My parents seemed to be happy that I was coping well. We lived in a good neighborhood, and our next-door neighbor, a German fellow by the name of Mr Anderson who always wore sunglasses and had a pot belly, would often invite us over for barbecues and such. Luke and Missile would join in on occasion, and we would talk about life, school, and anything really, before popping in Mario Party in Mr Anderson's Wii and playing to our heart's content. Life was going pretty well. Then, I met her. Her name was Trucy, and I will forever remember the day I first laid my eyes on her. It was in art class, and amidst the smell of stale paint and canvas I caught a whiff of perfume. I looked up, and there she was. Beautiful brown curls framed her perfect, blue-eyed face. And that smile. Oh god. I swear I collaped into a dreamy, unmanly heap on the table for the entire lesson which followed. When I met up with Luke and Missile in the cafeteria, my thoughts still dwelled on her. Luke must have sensed that something was going on, because he waved his hand in front of me, saying ""Earth to Arlon, Earth to Arlon, Arlon do you copy"", which snapped me out of my trance-like state. ""What's with you man?"" he asked. ""You're not your usual self today."" ""Oh, Nothing."" I lied. But, of course, they found out eventually. And they were really cool about it. Turns out, Missile knew Trucy from Economics, so with that in mind, we started to brainstorm ideas on how to approach her. Luke suggested we take it slow. ""What about you 'invite' us all to the movies, Missile?"" he said. ""We'll book tickets, then get trucy next to Arlon. We can work it out from there."" We did exactly that, and it turned out pretty well. Better, in fact, than I expected -- we managed to exchange phone numbers. Missile and Luke congratulated me on a job well done, then we went to get Taco Bell. There, we planned our next course of action. Over the next few weeks, Trucy and I got to know each other, whether through phone calls or the clandestine operations Luke and Missile helped me arrange. Soon, I didn't need their help anymore, and we went on our first date together at a park (yes, very creative I know). It was then that I knew I had to tell her. ""Trucy?"" ""Yes Arlon?"" ""There's something... i need to tell you."" ""What is it?"" I hesitated. Then, I saw them. Sitting on a bench reading newspapers. Cheeky bastards, turns out they had arranged this too? Luke smiled and gave me a thumbs-up while Missile mouthed ""Just do it."" So I did it. ""I... I kinda like you, hehe"" (it probably sounded even more awkward than it does here) ""Oh, Arlon"" And we shared our first kiss. I was in heaven. My heaven would last through the three years we dated. Then, just when I thought our relationship was truly budding, we broke up. Yes, it was that abrupt. Trucy loved someone else now, and I was left behind. The feeling in my chest that I experienced that day, cannot be described in words. Suffice to say, I was devastated, heartbroken. I went home the day she broke up with me without speaking a word to anyone. When I got home, I shut the door and tried to rationalise with myself. ""It's ok Arlon. You'll manage. There are plenty other girls out there"" ""Don't be sad Arlon. it was not meant to be."" But the more I thought about it, the worse I felt. Over the next few days, Luke and Missile tried to talk me out of it, tried to make me forget it, get it over with. But it did not help. I slipped further and further into depression. Yes, I started hanging out late and doing drugs. Yes, I started doing alcohol. I went from respectable, generally nice guy to a coke-snorting, chain-smoking hobo. But through all this, Luke and Missile stood by me. Shame on me that I didn't appreciate them then. I remember once, I, in a drunken stupor, smashed a bottle and used it to stab Missile, who was trying to stop me from drinking so much ( and probably get alcohol poisoning). That was the end of it between me and Missile. I tried committing suicide once. I climbed to the top of the roof and jumped down. I got caught in some tree branches and ended up on the ground with only a gash across my leg. I cursed the heavens loudly for letting me survive. Mr Anderson, alerted by the noise, quickly brought me in and wrapped up my wound. I sobbed as he picked up the phone to dial my parents, who were at work. A year later, I saw Trucy outside a bar with her new boyfriend. I couldn't control myself and rushed up to them. ""YOU RUINED MY LIFE!"" The two of them were taken by surprise and the boyfriend raised his fist. ""YOU TOOK HER FROM ME"" I yelled. ""YOU TOOK MY LIFE FROM ME!"" and I swung wildly at him. Suddenly, there was an excruciating pain in my abdomen. I screamed, then I collapsed. Next thing I remember seeing was the cold, sterile hospital ceiling. I awoke to find Luke, Trucy and my parents by my side, her boyfriend leaning against the wall. The doctor came in, and revealed to me that I had a tumor in my liver. I started to cry. I had wasted my life, all my potential, over one stupid breakup. Why did I start doing drugs? Why did I start doing alcohol? ""It should be okay,"" the doctor said. ""But we'll need to monitor it for a while to look for any unusual developments. Rest now, ok?"" My tears turned into those of joy. It was like being born again. I had a second chance. It was time to turn over a new leaf. At the advice of Mr Anderson, my parents put aside their pride and hired a professional counsellor to guide me through the tough times. I also had to take antidepressants. But I was getting better. Trucy agreed that she had handled the breakup badly, and we promised to keep in touch, if only just as friends. I would laze in the couch feeling a little blue. Today, I was feeling it a little more than usual. I started playing Metal Gear Soild V half-heartedly to take my mind off it, when the doorbell rang. It was Luke. ""Came to visit,"" he said. ""How are things?"" ""Oh, they're alright."" We chatted for a while. Then he said. ""Cheer up, old sport. Here, have a look at this, figured you would find it funny."" He whipped out his iPhone 6 and opened up 4chan. And that's how I got cancer.",human,55nvn1,2,1475504678,0,8116,8116,1554,4.222651222651223,131

"The tale of Louise.

Once upon a time there was a 7-year-old girl named Louise. Now from a young age Louise had always had an interest in science. Someday she wanted to be an astronaut, to pilot a spaceship, and to explore alien worlds, but she didn't have time for any of those things. You see, Louise's family owned this farm, and any time Louise wanted to, say, build a model spaceship or \""plot her Mars base\"" (complete with a room that was filled with kitty cats!), as she would often do, her father would say \""Sorry, Louise, there's manure to scoop.\"" and she would have to go and shovel manure. So Louise would go and she'd shovel the manure. \n\nLouise had a secret, however. She had discovered this secret the day after her older sister moved out. One of the walls in her room could slide back to reveal a hidden room. Inside this room she kept all her \""space gear\"": space goggles, a map of the solar system, a series of stories she wrote about this alien race she made up and all the hell that would break loose when humans encounter them. \n\nToday was Louise's 14th birthday, and she was tired of shoveling manure. Louise wanted nothing more than to finally speak her mind. She wanted to become a scientist, not work on some farm for the rest of her life. Her parents were eventually persuaded. When she was 18 she left and went to college, got a master's degree in astrophysics, and got a job at NASA.\n\nLouise eventually met a fantastic man named Matt and they fell in love. Within three years they were married and they had one child, a girl named Cassie. Cassie was also interested in science and, of course, her parents were far more allowing of that than Louise's had been.\n\nBut all was not perfect. Matt, unfortunately, was killed in a car crash when Cassie was 10. Louise did her best to raise her child on her own.\n\nCassie went on to discover a strange new species of rabbit found deep underground. They were quite intelligent, and they could breathe without needing oxygen. Cassie had the idea that these rabbits could be used to explore Mars. And soon, Mike and Jake, two space rabbits, were sent out on a mission to Mars.\n\nMike and Jake, while piloting the spaceship, discovered that there was a stowaway on their ship. Who could it be? \n\nThey looked around. \n\nThen they searched some more.\n\nThe stowaway was hard to find, but eventually they found him, a rabbit named Kevin. Now Kevin was very annoying, and he annoyed the crap out of Mike and Jake while they tried to make it to Mars. Still, there was nothing the two NASA rabbits could do, they were pretty close to approaching Mars and their best option was just to go with it.\n\nSo the three space rabbits landed on Mars eventually. Mike was excited, Jake was kinda scared, and Kevin had resorted to singing \""1000 bottles of beer on the wall\"". They wandered around the planet rather aimlessly for a while, with nothing to really report. They traveled and traveled and traveled and it seemed like they had been there for an eternity. Eventually, the rabbits heard a strange noise with their large rabbit ears.\n\n*thump thump thump thump thump*\n\nThey wondered what that noise could be and started to make their way towards it. Eventually the sound grew louder.\n\n*THUMP THUMP THUMP*\n\nAnd eventually it sounded like... a beat? Music perhaps?\n\n*T H U M P T H U M P T H U M P T H U M P*\n\nAnd... they saw it. A silhouette over the horizon. It looked like a rock. No, it was a house. A house? On Mars? Kevin was still annoying as ever and now down to \""4 bottles of beer on the wall\"".\n\nThey traveled closer to the house. It was definitely a house. A giant mansion of a house. And it was packed to the brim with martians having a party of some sort. \n\nThere were martians in the pool, martians on the roof, martians dead on the pavement. The space rabbits were hungry after their long trip and decided to grab some pizza at this party. But the line to get the pizza was RIDICULOUSLY long. It went upstairs, downstairs again, out the door and around the house at least five times. They gave up on getting pizza. What rabbits eat pizza anyways? So they decided to get some snacks. Chips, pretzels, and the like. But this line was even longer. It went upstairs, downstairs again, out the door and around the house at least ten times. The rabbits were famished and parched. Then, they saw it. They saw it at last. Adventurous Louise, spirited Cassie, and obnoxious Kevin had all led up to this moment. This moment when they could be the first rabbits to set foot on Mars, and, while on Mars consume a fruity drink. Do you know why? Well, there was no punch line.\n\n^^sorry",ai,ai_5012,0,0,1,4675,4675,839,4.572109654350418,66

"All his life, Harry wanted to be a cable-car operator...

... so one day he enrolled in cable-car operator school in New York. He was a fair student, but not great, and after several years of study, he graduated with a C average and was assigned as part of a job-placement program to a route in Manhattan. He loved his new job and everything was great for a while until one day he wasn't paying very close attention and lost control of his cable-car. It hopped its track and careened off of a pier into the Hudson River. All of his passengers were killed but Harry managed to swim back to shore. He was terrified of what would happen so he fled the scene (and, eventually, the city) before police and rescue crews could arrive. He settled in Houston under an assumed name and took a job in a grocery store, trying to keep as low a profile as possible. He lived a quiet life, and every day he would watch the Houston cable-cars going up and down the street and he longed for what he had lost. One day, he decided that he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school again, this time in Houston and under his new name. He did a little better this time, having been through the classwork before, and graduated with a B average and was assigned to a nice route in La Porte. His passengers loved him and he loved his job. But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable car. It hopped its track and ended up in Trinity Bay. All of his passengers were killed, but Harry managed to swim back to shore. Fearing that authorities would put this accident together with the one in New York, he again fled the scene. This time he ended up in San Francisco with yet another assumed name. He figured that, if he couldn't operate his beloved cable cars (for fear of getting caught), he could at least see them everywhere he went, as San Francisco is the cable-car capital of the world. This satisfied him for a little while, but eventually he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school yet again. He excelled in his classwork this time around (having been through the program twice before) and graduated magna cum laude. He was assigned the highly-coveted Market Street route and drove it for quite a while without incident. But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable-car. It hopped its tracks and ended up in the San Francisco Bay. All of his passengers were killed and as Harry swam back to shore, the police were waiting for him. In the subsequent investigation and trial, prosecutors put all the pieces together. They figured that he was the same guy who killed all those people in Houston and New York. It was the trial of the century and at the end of it, Harry was sentenced to die in the electric chair for his crimes (the actions having been deemed so egregiously willful and persistent as to constitute premeditation). He was transferred to Alcatraz to await his execution. He was a model prisoner, never causing any trouble, and every day he woke and did exactly 52 jumping jacks and 52 sit-ups and 52 push-ups in his cell to keep himself occupied. The day before his scheduled execution, the warden came to him and asked what he would like for his last meal. Harry thought about it for a minute and said “I would like a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk”. The warden stared blankly at him. “Harry,” he said, “we have access to the best chefs in the world. This is your last meal, and you can have anything you want. Steak, lobster, name it!” Harry shook his head and repeated his request for a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk. His disgusting meal was brought to him and he wolfed it down hungrily. The next day, his head was shaved and last rites were administered, and Harry was led to the electric chair and hooked up. At the appointed time, prison guards threw the switch and counted to ten before turning off the current to the chair. But Harry was fine. Smoldering a bit at the spots where the contacts met his skin, perhaps, but otherwise the picture of health. Flummoxed, the guards took Harry back to his cell and began the long process of checking and rechecking their equipment for malfunctions, but they couldn’t find anything. A new execution date was set for one month later, and Harry went back to his morning exercise routine of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups to keep his mind and body occupied while he waited. The eve of his second execution arrived and the warden visited Harry again to take the order for his last meal. “A rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk,” Harry said. The warden just shook his head and asked him Harry was sure, then arranged to have his meal brought to him. The next day, guards shaved his head again, Harry was administered his last rites again, and he was marched to the electric chair and hooked up again. This time, though, they weren’t taking any chances. At the appropriate time, they threw the switch and left the juice flowing for a full minute. And when they were finished, Harry was just fine. The warden was nervous. A little known California law stipulated that the state could only make three attempts to execute a prisoner, and if that failed they had to let him go. Harry was returned to his cell where he resumed his daily morning exercise regimen of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups. Another month passed, and on the eve of his third execution, Harry was visited by the warden, who just said “let me guess” as he wheeled in a cart with a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk. Harry thanked him politely and ate his dinner. The next morning, they shaved his head (AGAIN!) and delivered last rites (AGAIN!) and marched him to the execution chamber, where he was hooked up (AGAIN!) to the electric chair. This time, prison officials weren’t taking any chances. The entire Bay Area power grid was diverted to Alcatraz. They threw the switch (cutting electricity to millions of customers) and left the juice running for a full half hour. The execution chamber buzzed with the awesome power being fed into the chair. You could taste the ions in the air. And when they turned off the power…. Harry was just fine. The warden shook his head in disbelief. “Well, Harry,” he said, “we have to let you go. California law stipulates that we can only make three attempts at an execution. But before I do, I really have to know. How did you survive three executions? Was it the jumping jacks, the sit-ups, and the push-ups? Was it the rotten banana, rotten apple, and spoiled milk? What IS your secret?” Harry just shook his head and shrugged, “I guess I’m just not a very good conductor.”",human,5ma3f2,788,1483660518,0,6749,6749,1224,4.513888888888889,69

"Trip to the aquarium joke

The other week I was in the aquarium having a whale of a time (pardon the pun). I saw sea horses, sharks, turtles, the whole shebang. But I couldn't wait to get to my favourite creature. I don't know why but I've always been fascinated by eels. I did a project on them in primary school and since then they've just stuck with me. I can name every single breed of them without even trying.\n \nSo I get to the eel section which is crowded beyond belief. I mean I love eels but most people just kind of glance at them on the way to the stingrays. Today there were so many people there I couldn't even see the tank. I managed to push myself to the front, accidentally shoving a toddler, and saw what all the fuss was about. \n\nThere they were, all swimming about, hidingin crevices, doing what eels do best. Except one. I couldn't actually believe it but right in the middle of the tank there was an eel. Biggest eel in there. And it was singing. Clear as day it was singing. I don't know how we were all hearing it through the glass and the water but we could see its mouth moving perfectly with the words. It even hummed some of the music at one point so I know it wasn't a trick. It only sang the one song though, this old love song that I can't remember the name of. It's really popular though,used in loads of movies, especially ones about Italy. \n\nI couldn't believe it, I'd never seen an eel do this before. I knew so much about eels and yet I'd never heard of this kind before. I managed to spot an employee on the other side of the room and struggled my way over. I somehow got his attention over the noise of all the people and the singing eel. \n\n\""How the hell does an eel know that song? How is it able to sing?

Before long, the pony started behaving strangely, walking slowly and irregularly and not responding to the cowboys commands.

"Being Muslim is tough

Since i was a young boy my father has imposed his religion onto me. I was home schooled because we live in the west and my father wanted me in an environment that was free from anything Haram. I couldn't associate with Hindus or Christians, anyone who ate unclean animals, or any girl. As a teenage guy going through puberty this was naturally a living nightmare. After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Hindu friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Hindus and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae.",human,fqubje,4502,1585435199,0,1581,1581,316,4.003164556962025,19
"JOKES...as told by a German perspective

**THIS IS LONG BUT HAD TO SHARE HERE; HOPE YOU ALL APPRECIATE THIS AS MUCH AS I DO**\n\nGERMAN JOKES\n\nKnock, knock.\nWho's there?\nThe police. I'm afraid there's been an accident. Your husband is in hospital.\n\nA man walks into a pub.\nHe is an alcoholic whose drink problem is destroying his family.\n\nDid you hear about the blonde who jumped out off a bridge?\nShe was clinically depressed and took her own life because of her terribly low self-esteem.\n\nWhat do you call a cat with no tail?\nA Manx cat.\n\nWhy do undertakers wear ties?\nBecause their profession is very serious, and it is important that their appearance has a degree of gravitas.\n\nHow many electricians does it take to change a light bulb?\nOne.\n\nHow many engineers does it take to change a light bulb?\nNone, it is far more efficient in both time and money to change it yourself. Failing that, ask a relative or neighbour to change it for you.\n\nWhy do women fake orgasms?\nBecause they want to give men the impression that they have climaxed.\n\nTwo men are sitting in a pub.\nOne man turns to the other and says: 'Last night I saw lots of strange men coming in and out of your wife's house.'\nThe other man replies: 'Yes, she has become a prostitute to subsidise her drug habit.'\n\nTwo cows are in a field. Suddenly, from behind a bush, a rabbit leaps out and runs away.\nOne cow looks round a bit, eats some grass and then wanders off.\n\nWhy are there no aspirin in the jungle?\nBecause it would not be financially viable to attempt to sell pharmaceuticals in the largely unpopulated rainforest.\n\nWhat do you get when you cross a chicken with a centipede? \nA media circus about the debate over the morals and ethics of genetic engineering. \n\nSo, there were an Irishman, an Englishman and an American wrecked on an island. One day, they found a bottle, and when they opened it, a ghost came out and offered them each a wish. However, even though they wished for different stuff, nothing happened, as the three guys of varying nationalities were just having shared hallucinations from hunger. \n\nHow do you drown a blonde?\nHold her head underwater until she can no longer breathe and stops struggling. \n\nWhy did the blonde get fired from the M&M factory?\nRepeated absences and stealing. \n\nA black man is going to get a vasectomy. He shows up to the doctor's office wearing a suit. The doctor says, \""Why are you wearing a suit?\"" The black man says, \""I just got back from a funeral\"" \n\nWhat do you say to a woman with two black eyes? \n\""Would you like an ice pack?\"" \n\nWhy did the deaf man take his parrot to work? \nHe was weird. \n\nA Blonde and a Brunette jump off a tall building at the same time. Who hits the ground first? \nBoth of them hit the ground at the same time. Hair colour doesn't affect acceleration due to gravity. \n\nWhat's worse then finding a worm in your apple? \nThe Holocaust. \n\nA man walks into a whorehouse and pays a prostitute for sex. He contracts an STD and passes it onto his pregnant wife. Their child is born deformed and has a difficult life. \nWhen asked if he could see the humour in the situation, the child replied, \""No. No, I don't.\"" \n\nA man called a lawyer and asked, \""How much will you charge me to answer three questions?\"" \nThe lawyer said \""$400.\"" \n\""Wow,\"" said the man. \""Isn't that a lot?\"" \n\""I guess so,\"" said the lawyer. \""When are you going to ask your questions?\"" \n\nHow do you know when a Frenchman has been near your house? \nYou don't, really, unless you were there to see him or if one of your neighbors saw him. I wouldn't worry about it, really. \n\nThree men are at the FBI Building for a job interview. The interviewing FBI agent tells the first man, 'To be in the FBI you must be loyal, dedicated, and give us your all. Your wife is in the next room. I want you to go in there and shoot her with this gun.' \nThe man takes the gun, hesitates, and says, 'Sorry, I can't do it.' \nThe next interviewee enters the office and the agent tells him the same thing he told the first guy. The second man takes the gun, walks into the room, and walks out. 'Sorry, I can't.' he says. \nThe last man enters the office and the interviewer said yet again explains the test.' The man says \""I'm sorry I love my wife too much to do such a harmful thing, I guess the FBI is not for me after all.\"" \n\nWhat's sad about 4 black people in a Cadillac going over a cliff? \nThey were my friends. \n\nWhy did the chicken cross the road? \nEarlier that morning the farmers daughter had inadvertently left the gate to the yard open as she was preoccupied by her worry over a maths test set for that day. She hadn't studied for the test as she was still deeply distressed over her fathers recent heart attack. This, coupled with the added burden of household chores now delegated to her because her mother was out trying to get the west field prepared for sowing, had made her quite forgetful and distracted of late.\nWhilst several chickens escaped, only one strayed so far that it actually encountered the road facing the farm. After crossing the road and gorging itself in a soybean crop, the chicken was struck by a furniture removers van as it attempted to make its way home. \nSeveral hours later the dead chicken was spotted by a Community Mental Health Worker who was doing his bi-weekly rural clinic run. The chicken, being a bantam caught the eye of the Mental Health worker, who was a keen trout fisherman. \n\""Cool\"" thought the mental health worker- \""those feathers will make for excellent trout flies\"". He stopped and plucked a handful of the most iridescent blue, green and orange feathers and placed them in an envelope. He rolled himself a cigarette, sat on the trunk of his car and admired the clouds. \""God, I love this job\"", he muttered to no one in particular.\n\nSatan takes the form of Jesus and appears to three priests saying that if they do something evil, he'll let them drink of the holy water. \nThe three priests discuss the offer and come to the conclusion that Satan must be tricking them into committing sin. When confronted with this accusation, Satan reveals his dastardly plot and salutes the priests on their cunning and steadfast faith. \n\nWhy couldn't Helen Keller drive? \nBecause she was blind and deaf. \n\nOtto and Beata give birth to a young child. \nThis is impossible, because a baby cannot be born as a young child, therefore the previous sentence is rendered void and should be corrected. I apologise on behalf of myself, and myself only, for this major yet forgivable mistake.\n\nThe Pope walks into a bar. The bartender says, what'll ya have, Pope? But the Pope's grasp of English is tenuous at best, so he mumbles something in Latin. The bartender doesn't know any Latin. The Pope gets frustrated and leaves. \n\nHave you seen Stevie Wonder's new house? \nNo. \nWell, it's really nice. \n\nWhere did Hitler keep his armies? \nThe brunt of his forces were applied to the Eastern front, but throughout different periods of the war, a sizable chunk were used to protect the Atlantic Wall and a handful of divisions were used in Africa, to secure shipping routes. \n\nA kid is riding down the street when his chain pops off his bicycle. The kid yells \""God damn!\"" as he begins to fix it. A priest walking nearby overhears the boy taking god's name in vein and says \""Don't say 'God damn' say 'God help us'\"". \nThe kid says, \""I am an atheist, get away from me\"". \n\nWhat's the difference between a Jew and a pizza? \nA Jew is a person adhering to the Jewish faith and a pizza is an oven-baked, flat, usually circular bread covered with tomato sauce and cheese with optional garnishes. \n\nWhat do you get when you turn 3 blondes upside-down?\nAn embarrassing situation \n\nWhy did the blonde tattoo her zip code on her stomach?\nShe was a schizophrenic. \n\nHow do you confuse a blonde?\nPaint yourself green and throw forks at her. \n\nWhat's the deal with airline peanuts?\nThe packaging is generally poorly designed and cheaply made, as a method of cutting distribution costs. After all, most passengers wouldn't want a \""Peanut Fee\"" attached to their already costly ticket prices in order to cover the expenses of higher quality wrappers. What are you complaining about, anyway? It's free food, and it's a nice snack. If you're really that bent on not enjoying the peanuts the airline so graciously provided you with, just save them and give them to the next homeless person you see. People these days are really selfish. \n\nHow do you make a Swiss roll? \nGenerally it involves a thin layer of sponge cake and a layer of either jam or cream. The resulting flat sheet of cake and cream is then rolled into a cylinder. It's quite delicious, actually. \n\nWhat's the difference between Michael Jackson and a shopping bag.\nOne is a famous singer songwriter facing charges of child molestation and the other's a thin plastic sheet formed into a shape most fitting to carrying large amounts of shopping so that its easier to carry. \n\nHow many mice does it take to screw in a lightbulb? \nI imagine it would take a great many. Mice would find it difficult to reach a ceiling light fitting, and would individually lack the strength or dexterity required to turn a bulb in such a socket. Even if you had enough mice to lend their strength to such an endeavor, the chances of them having the intelligence and wherewithal to perform such a complex activity is really quite low. \n\nA blonde girl walks into the local dry cleaners. She places a garment on the counter. \""I'll be back tomorrow afternoon to pick up my dress.\"" she says. \n\""Come again?\"" says the clerk, cupping his ear. \n\""I said 'I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW AFTERNOON TO PICK UP MY DRESS',\"" says the girl, this time louder. \n\nA man walks past a bar and sees a sign which says \""PERFORM THE THREE FEATS AND WIN A MILLION DOLLARS!\"" Thinking that a million dollars sounds like a great idea, he goes inside and asks the bartender what the deal is. \n\""First,\"" says the bartender, \""you have to chug this entire bottle of vodka. Second, there's a crocodile in the back room with a bad tooth. You have to pull it. Third, there's an eighty-five year old woman in the back who's never had sex. You have to have sex with her.\"" \nThe guy think it over and says \""okay, sure. You have a deal!\"" He grabs the bottle of vodka and, with little effort due to the fact that he's basically a professional alcoholic anyway, downs it. Then he slams the empty bottle down and goes into the back room. There's a lot of screaming, some growling, and various crashing sounds. Finally a silence falls upon the bar. Minutes pass, then an hour. Finally the bartender sends a barmaid back to see what's going on. A few minutes later, she comes back out. \n\""What's he doing?\"" asks the bartender. \n\""What's left of him is back there in the croc pen,\"" she says, her horrified face pale with shock. \""His clothes are tossed in the corner. I think he tried to fuck the croc. The croc...the croc ate him.\"" \n\""Oh, Jesus,\"" whispers the bartender. \""Jesus.\"" \nNobody says a word. \n\nA man has been trapped on a desert island for 8 years. One day, he sees a boat on the horizon and lights a fire to let it know he is there. \nThe boat comes towards the shore. On board there is a beautiful woman in a body hugging wetsuit. \n\""Thank God\"", he says, \""I've been trapped on this island for eight years. Thank god someone has come at last.\"" \n\""Eight years?\"" she says, \""So it's eight years since you last smoked a Cuban cigar?\"" \nShe unzips a pocket on her wetsuit and pulls out a cigar. She passes it to him, pulls out a Zippo, and lights it for him. He enjoys the first cigar he has had in eight years. \n\""So is it also eight years since you had a drink?\"" \nShe unzips a pocket on her wetsuit and pulls out a hip flask, tossing it to him. He takes a swig, and it's 25 year old single malt whisky. It's smooth and mellow and utterly delicious. \n\""So,\"" she says, beginning to unzip the long zipper on the front of her costume, \""Is it eight years since you played around?\"" \n\""Oh no,\"" he says, \""This is all a dream, isn't it? A beautiful woman with whiskey and cigars wanting to have sex with me? I must be dreaming.\"" \nSuddenly he is woken up by a flash of lightning. It's the middle of the night, and he is all alone in his primitive shelter on his desert island. So alone... so terribly alone. \n\nAn Illinois man left the snowballed streets of Chicago for a vacation in Florida. His wife was on a business trip and was planning to meet him there the next day. When he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick e-mail. \nUnable to find the spool of paper on which he had written her e-mail address, he did his best to type it in from memory. Unfortunately, he missed one letter, and his note was directed instead to an elderly preacher's wife whose husband had passed away only the day before. When the grieving widow checked her e-mail, she took one look at the monitor, did not recognize the sender's name, and rightly deduced that she was not the intended recipient. She replied, pointing out the man's mistake, who then resent the e-mail to the proper address. \n\nWhat's the difference between a duck? \nI'm sorry, I was typing too quickly and missed off the end of my sentence. I meant to say \""What's the difference between a duck and a goose?\"" and the answer is that they are entirely different species of waterfowl. \n\nWhat do you call 5 Mexicans in quicksand?\nA dangerous situation that could soon turn tragic. \n\nFour blondes are driving to Disneyworld. They finally get to Florida and they see a sign that says \""Disneyworld: left\"" so they take the left and have a wonderful time at what many people believe to be the most magical place on Earth. \n\nA Mexican, a Texan, a Brit, and a Frenchman are flying on a plane when one of the engines goes out. The pilot comes out and says \""we're too heavy, one of you will have to jump!\"" The Mexican looks at the Texan, the Brit looks at the Frenchmen, but they all decide that they don't want to jump out of the plane. The pilot attempts an emergency landing but without a runway and only 3 engines the plane hits at too harsh an angle and explodes. \n\nHow do you make a blonde's eyes light up? \nDo something really nice for her, like buy her the piece of jewelry she looks at every time you go into the mall, or bake her a cake. If you have the time and effort, make her something. People appreciate thought and effort in a present more than money. \n\nWhy don't Polish girls swim in the sea? \nThe only sea that Poland borders on is the Baltic. Throughout most of the year this sea is too cold to comfortably swim in. \n\nThere once was a man from Nantucket. He owned a sailboat. I haven't seen him in years. \n\nAs their plane spirals towards the ground, a young man asks the pretty girl next to him if she would have sex with him, as he does not want to die a virgin. Surprised by this request, she declines, stating that in addition to the sheer inappropriateness of the idea, the mechanics of copulating in a crashing aircraft seem very difficult if not impossible. He agrees and admits that he was only trying to lighten the mood. However, she was busy putting on her oxygen mask and didn't hear this last bit. They both spend the last moments of their lives in anxious reflection.\n\nA man walks into a bar. \nHe orders a couple of drinks, pays for them, and then proceeds to leave the premises, as his wife had told him that he must not be too late home.\n\nA horse walks into a bar.\nThe barman immediately calls the local stable to report the missing stallion, and his owner promptly arrives to take him home. He thanks the landlord and offers a small reward, but it is respectfully declined.\n\nWhat's eighteen inches long, stiff, and makes women scream at night?\nA twelve inch long penis that is erect, thus adding approximately one half of its flaccid size, and involved in the act of fornication with the female partner of the man whose penis I am describing. (Of course, it is ignorant and juvenile to assume that the man in question is heterosexual. He may be a homosexual, which is perfectly acceptable in these liberal times we live in, or he may in fact be single and not inclined towards a sexual preference of any kind. This is understandable due to the myriad complications of long-term relationships, a result of the infinite differences between the masculine and feminine psyches.)\n\nPATIENT: Doctor doctor, I feel like a pair of curtains!\nDOCTOR: I shall prescribe you some anti-depressant tablets, probably 20 miligrams to start with, and I shall book you an appointment with a psychiatrist. You will not be charged for his or her services, but you may have to wait up to seven weeks for your first meeting. I shall give you two prescriptions just in case, so that you don't run the risk of running out of medication and thus relapsing. You will have to return in two months as your counseller is unable to provide you with drugs. Have a nice day.\nPATIENT: Thank you, doctor. My mother will be pleased and relieved that I have finally sought your advice after many years of this inner personal anguish and turmoil.\nDOCTOR: You're very welcome. Could you please send my next patient in? He should have a large beard, unless he recently has shaved it, which I consider unlikely.\nPATIENT: Certainly, doctor. And thank you again.\n\nWhat's the difference between Smarties and sleeping pills?\nSmarties are a popular chocolate-based confectionary product from England, which were the inspiration for the arguably more successful M&M's produced by Mars. Sleeping pills are flavourless narcotics that are used primarily by people suffering from afflictions such as insomnia. Another difference between the two is the repurcussions of ingestion. In a large dose, Smarties can have a minor contribution to obesity, whereas a large dose - often referred to as an 'overdose' - of sleeping pills runs the risk of much more dangerous consequences such as immediate and fatal liver damage. It is generally accepted that sleeping pills should only be used when recommended or prescribed by a qualified doctor or chemist, but Smarties can be purchased at the majority of reputable supermarkets or corner shops.\n\nHow can you tell that your girlfriend's too young for you?\nOften the level of rapport enduced from conversations and activities is dependant on sharing mutual interests and beliefs. A significant age gap can compromise this, although it is not a concrete determiner of a relationship's potential success. Another thing to take into account is that the legal age for consentual sex is 16, although it is often (wrongly) considered a taboo for a man of 20 years or older to date a lady who is less than 18, the minimum legal age for drinking in the United Kingdom. However, when the roles are reversed it can be considered a positive trait for a younger man to have a mature partner.\n\nWhat do you call a man with a tray on his head?\nIf you are aware of his given name, you may address him with this. If he had adopted a nickname by which he is comfortable to be known, using this would also be deemed acceptable. If, however, you do not already know what his name is, ask him to kindly inform you so that you may become acquainted. You may then ask him why he has a tray on his head, and he will quite likely answer you with humility and direct earnest.\n\nAn Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotsman walk into a bar. They have a few drinks, then go to a club, where they amuse each other and those around them by completely slurring their words in their already very strong regional accents. Then they get a taxi back to the house of the Englishman as he lives nearest, and stay the night. The next morning, the Scotsman and the Irishmen walk home as they are still hungover and do not wish to risk driving.\n\nWhat do Madeleine McCann's parents have in common with Rhys Jones's parents?\nBoth sets of parents outlived their infant children. (It is assumed, due to the substantial period of time since McCann went missing, that she is now deceased. However, this has yet to be confirmed by any official source.)\n\nDue to fewer intrinsic external differences between the facial structures of african people when compared to those of caucasians, Barack Obama is sometimes confused with Lewis Hamilton and Theo Walcott. Similarly, the current Israeli/Palestinian crisis is occasionally mistaken for that of footballer Paul Gascoigne. This is because Gascoigne was often endearingly known as 'Gazza', while the area of land most prominent in the Middle Eastern conflict is called Gaza - one letter away from the aforementioned 'Gazza', hence the confusion.\n\nA man walks into a pub and orders three pints. He sits down with them and drinks them all to himself, then goes back to the bar and orders another three pints. Once again, he drinks them all to himself and returns for three more pints. \nThe barman, understandably rattled, asks him why he keeps ordering three at a time. The man explains that he has two riplet brothers, both in other countries, and they always have three pints at a time to pretend that they're together. The barman is touched by this.\nThis continues for several months until one day the man comes in and only asks for two pints. The barman offers his condolences.\nThe man thanks him, and somberly finishes his drinks, in the knowledge that he will never again see his beloved brother.\n\nWhat do you get if you cross a gooseberry with a stereo?\nA sticky green residue that is difficult to remove from the electrical unit.\n\nA man dies and goes to heaven.\nThis is an assumption based on religious faith.\n\nWhy can't Stephen Hawking dance?\nHe has Motor Neurone syndrome.\n\nWhat's black, white, and hungry?\nThe population of Zimbabwe.\n\nA man is walking through the desert, searching desperately for water. Suddenly, he stumbles across a stall.\n\""Do you have any water, please?\"" he asks the merchant.\n\""Sorry mate, I only sell ties here\"" is the reply.\nThe man continues his increasingly futile bid for quenched thirst, and finally reaches another merchant.\n\""How can I help you, mate?\""\n\""Water! I need water!\""\n\""Well, you've come to the right place.\""\nSo the merchant gives the man some water, they shake hands, and have a long and hearty laugh over the redundancy of a tie shop in the desert.",ai,ai_6849,0,0,1,22547,22547,3925,4.744458598726115,239

"I Want A Divorce

A judge was interviewing a South Carolina woman regarding her pending divorce and asks, ""What are the grounds for your divorce?"" ""About four acres and a nice little home in the middle of the property with a stream running by."" ""No,"" he said, ""I mean what is the foundation of this case?"" ""It is made of concrete, brick, and mortar,"" she responded. ""I mean,"" he continued, ""what are your relations like?""

"While in China, an American man is sexually promiscuous and does not use a condom the entire time he is there.

"So, Beethoven dies....

When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave.

"Two brothers are walking in the countryside

They are on their way to their father, who needs help on his farm since he broke his leg. The brothers, being from the city, are clearly bothered by all the cow poop. And it's all they can complain about for the entire trip. The older brother has to pee and in the meantime the younger brother sneakily puts some of the cow poop in a plastic bag. For a prank later. But little did the little brother know that the big brother really didn't have to pee. He also filled a plastic bag with cow poop for a prank. So when the big brother returns the two boys continue walking as if nothing happened. In order to provoke the little brother about his upcoming prank, the big brother jokingly starts talking about ""Operation Poop"". But without actually revealing that he is going to pull off a prank. The Operation Poop thing becomes kind of an inside joke thing that the two brothers keep talking about, but without knowing of eachother that they both want to pull off a prank. 20 minutes later, they arrived at the dad's house. Since there are no hospitals near where the dad lives and he does not own a telephone, the dad asks his sons if they want to try to find a good stick for him. So he can use the stick to walk with. The stick has to be very solid and the dad recommends the brothers to look for a specific kind of stick that is used to hold up fences, because they are usually made from strong wood, thick and give no splinters. So the brothers start looking around for these kinds of sticks. They continued to talk about Operation Poop and eventually used the expression so often that they shortened it, so it can be said faster. Later on each went their own way so they don't look at the same spots all the time. After a while, the big brother finds a large sheet of paper with an advertisement sticked to a billboard. He decides that it could be useful for his prank. By wrapping the paper around the cow poop, he can make a ""poop bomb"" that shreds when it hits somebody at a high velocity. Covering the person in poop. Meanwhile, the little brother finds the absolute perfect stick for his dad. It is dry, perfectly round and wonderfully has no pieces of barbed wire or nails in it like all the other similar sticks. But instead of taking it, he decides to cover one side entirely in cow poop, and lay that side on the ground. So when the big brother finds the stick, his hand will be completely covered. Eventually the big brother finds the poop stick. He enthusiastically screams ""YES!!! It's perfect!"". The little brother hears it and runs a little closer to witness his prank happening. The big brother quickly grabs the stick without care. And the prank is successful. His hand is covered in poop. Disgusted, he shouts: ""This is a shitpost!"" . After a while he realized that the little brother did this as a prank. The poop has clear fingerprints on it. So the big brother angrily decides to execute ""Operation Poop"" and throws his own prank bomb at the little brother. Right into his face. The little brother, noticing what the object that just hit him was, shouted: ""OP is a shit poster!""",human,ahblc1,1,1547825539,0,3147,3147,582,4.407216494845361,38

There was this musician in North Korea. One day he was called upon by Kim Jong-Un himself to compose a piece of music and have an orchestra play it live to him in the great auditorium. The man, not wanting to displease the great leader did as he asked. The big night came. With the musician stood at the front the orchestra played his masterpiece. However they were terrible! “This isn’t how it’s supposed to sound!” The musician shouted at the orchestra, but the great leader was displeased and he called for the musician to be put to death. Upon arriving at the execution, the musician was asked what he’d like for his final meal. “I’d like a piping hot curry”, said the musician. After eating his curry, the hottest curry he’d eaten in a long time, he sat in the electric chair and awaited his fate.

He got straight to work, writing another piece of music, this time, his masterpiece. The night came, and he stood in front of his orchestra as they completely murdered his piece of music. “It wasn’t supposed to sound anything like that, nothing at all!” he exclaimed, but Kim Jong-Un isn’t the forgiving type and he sent the musician straight to the execution chamber. Again, the guards asked him what he wanted for his final meal. This time the musician asked for a curry hot enough to burn his eyes out. He chomped down the curry, teary eyed and sweating, then was strapped to the chair. Again they threw the switch and again the musician remained unaffected. Dumbfounded, the great leader said, “One last chance to prove your worth”, amazed that this man was actually still alive!

For the third time, the orchestra failed to play the music to how the musician had written it and yet again he was sent to the execution chamber, with Kim Jong-Un himself set to throw the switch. His final meal request was for the hottest curry ever made on this planet. “No” said the great leader, I've had it with you and your super hot curries. We’re putting you straight in the chair this time, no final meal, you’re not walking out of here unharmed” The musician was strapped in, the switch thrown by none other than Kim Jong-Un himself.

"Mexican fisherman

The American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellow fin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied, “Only a little while.” The American then asked, “Why didn’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” The Mexican said, “With this I have more than enough to support my family’s needs.” The American then asked, “But what do you do with the rest of your time?” The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life.” The American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing; and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat: With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor; eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York where you will run your ever-expanding enterprise.” The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?” To which the American replied, “15 to 20 years.” “But what then?” asked the Mexican. The American laughed and said that’s the best part. “When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.” “Millions?…Then what?” The American said, “Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”",ai,ai_8738,0,0,1,2090,2090,366,4.7103825136612025,19

Before he knows it, he's face to face with none other than God himself, Author of the Universe, Maker of All. God smiles beatifically and says, “Don't worry. The doctors working on you are good; you'll be back in no time. But as long as you're here, do you have any questions you'd like to ask?”\n\nThe antivaxer thinks and says, “I know there must be reasons, beyond our understanding, why evil is allowed to exist.

Just as so many people have tried to tell you over the years, vaccines are effective and far safer than the diseases they protect against. I give you My Word on that.

"Everyone needs a little relaxation time once in a while [Long]

So my friend and I decided to unwind and visit this Day Spa that she highly recommended. I had never heard of it before and asked her what was so great about it. However she refused to tell me why it was so good. So we scheduled a visit for the following Sunday and when we arrived I realised why I’d never heard of it before. It was literally named ‘Day Spa’ When we arrived we were greeted by this pretty looking receptionist who checked us in and directed us to a dressing room to get changed into the spa provided dressing gowns. We left our things in a nearby locker and walked deeper into the spa. At this point my friend has this huge grin on her face and finally decides to tell me why this place is so good. She explains that there are 26 different rooms of treatment each labelled A-Z and each specialising in different treatments from foot rubs to full body massages to hot stones. So we agreed to split up and meet back up in 2 hours. The first room I go into is room A. It’s quiet, and the only thing in the room is a single seat with an A engraved on it as well as a curtain. So I sit down and almost instantly this beautiful woman pops out from behind the curtain and starts placing various hot towels on different parts of my body. 15 mins later she takes them away and I get off of the seat, thoroughly relaxed and a lot less tense. Next I go into room F and, just like in room A there sits a single seat with the letter F engraved on it. I take a seat and hear a clanking sound beneath me. Before I can wonder what it is, the floor suddenly sinks into a circular hole. I was quite startled, that is until the hole started filling with warm water and the air was filled with a sweet, thick aroma. ‘Herbal bath’ I realised. ‘Not bad’ Another 30 minutes pass and I decide I want to try something else, so I go to stand up but at that moment the floor starts to rise again and the water sinks back into the floor. ‘Neat’ I think to myself. I try a few other rooms and they’re all pretty similar at first glance with the seats being engraved with whatever room number they were in. That is until is get to room O, where I see a big line has formed with people waiting excitedly at the door. I spot my friend at the end of the line and ask her why everyone’s so eager to get into this room. She tells me that this is the best room in the entire day spa and that people sometimes book months in advance to reserve the seat. After 30 minutes or so of queueing, it’s my friend’s turn, 5 minutes later she comes out with the most relaxed and calm look on her face. I ask her what happened but she just winks at me and said I’ll “find out” I walk into the room and excitedly sit myself on seat O. Suddenly, a team of masseuses walk out from behind the curtain and begin to massage all over my body. They use hot wax, stones, towels, and every type of lotion and ointment I can recognise, and many I can’t. The music is also stunning, with angelic choirs and lustrous saxophones playing softly in the back ground 5 minutes later I meet my friend outside and we leave the day spa, feeling utterly calm and relaxed. About a week later, some other friends of mine are discussing ways they like to relax. One of them says that music helps her unwind, another says she uses walks through the forest. They turn to me and ask what I use to relax. I reply: Day Spa, Seat O.",human,8yccld,6,1531420026,0,3435,3435,675,4.088888888888889,33

There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.\n\nI felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place.

"So there was this guy who wanted to be a train conductor.

Now this is more of a story than a joke, but bear with me... \n\nSo back in the 30's or sometime there was this guy who desperately wanted to be a train conductor. It all started in his early childhood. Ya see, he was orphaned from a very young age, but he still had very vivid memories of his parents. Now, his parents were horrible people, they abused him, and most of all scoffed at his aspirations of becoming a train conductor. He had run away and took up residence in the local orphanage. There all he dreamed of was being a REAL train conductor. He told all the staff, and they all supported his dreams. Several years pass and one day the owner of the orphanage came up to him and says:\n\""I am friends with the conductor at the train station, he's an old man like me and he's going to be retiring soon. He wanted to finish out this year, but he has offered you the position of ticket collector, so you can see how he runs the show. Once he retires you would be the new train conductor.\""\n\nNow at this point our guy is elated. His dreams are coming true! He agrees to take the ticket collector position and will start the following morning. He wakes up at the crack of dawn and sets off for the train station. Everything was going well, he collects tickets flawlessly for about 3 or 4 months. During the middle of his shift, he notices a woman that has a striking resemblance to his mother. His mother was not in the same ballpark as anyone who is considered attractive, and he assumes it's her immediately. His heart starts racing, and he walks straight up to her. He takes his ticket puncher and begins to beat her with it. Now I'm not going to go into the gory details about how he's using this ticket puncher, but just know it is gruesome. There's blood everywhere, small circular patches of skin all over the floor and the seats. The passengers are mortified. He kills this woman, and the police arrest him, he pleads guilty, is sentenced to death, and is taken to prison. \n\nHe is scheduled to be executed in a week, and like any man would, is dreading it. He thinks about how he would have done things differently, and maybe controlled his emotions if he was put in this scenario again. The night before his execution is a really stormy night, and his spirits are as low as ever. The jail guard senses that he's down and thinks he can cheer him up a bit with his last meal. A slight smile appears across his face, and he asks for his favorite, chicken fried steak, with a side of fried okra. He eats everything on the plate and asks for more. \n\nThe method of execution during this time was the electric chair, and the operators were getting it set up for its next victim. The execution is going quite normally, or as normally as any execution can go, and our guy sits down in his chair. They put the hat on his head. Strap him down. Ask for any last words. Then begin to electrocute him. This execution is more spectacular than any other execution these men have ever seen before. There's smoke, violent thrashing, and worst of all screaming. After a minute or so they cut the power.\n\nHe's sitting in the chair very motionless. They begin to unstrap him and much to their surprise he sits up! Now his punishment was to be electrocuted by the electric chair, and he was in fact electrocuted in the electric chair. They can't punish the poor man again, so they release him hoping he's learned his lesson.\n\nHe picks up his job collecting tickets again and is told if he does anything wrong again, he's out of there. Once again several months pass, and as he is collecting tickets, he runs into a man who is reminiscent of his father. His mother was bad, but to him his father was worse. He doesn't even have the composure to walk over to him. He breaks out into a sprint down 3 train cars. He tackles the man and once again murders him (much more brutally than the last one). The same thing happens that happened to him last time. He is sent to court. Sentenced to death by the electric chair, and sent to prison. He asks for a last meal, which he is denied, and is sitting in the electric chair the next day.\n\nThis time the operators aren't fucking around. They douse this guy in water. Turn up the power to levels that are high enough to kill an elephant. They turn it on, and just as last time there is a shitload of thrashing, screaming smoke, and the smell of burning hair and flesh. They leave that sucker on for muccchhh too long for anyone to possibly survive it. They cut the power, and check to see if the man still lives. Much to their dismay he, although burned, hairless, and in a world of hurt, sits up. The lead operator loses his mind and gets in his face. \n\n\""HOW! How are you still alive!? I understand that the first time it may have been a freak accident, but this time we were going to make SURE you were dead.\"" \n\nOur guy looks him straight in the eyes, and with a quiet, raspy voice, he says \""I guess I'm just not a very good conductor\"".\n\n \nNow I'm kinda new here and I don't know if this joke has been here before. Thanks for reading it and I hope someone out there liked it. c:",ai,ai_7635,0,0,1,5192,5192,973,4.336073997944501,65
"What's the difference between a girder and a joist?

The foreman is an older English fellow who doesn't care for Irishmen, thinks they're drunks and dumb and unreliable. But he knows he can't just come out and say that. So, the foreman says, ""Now, see here chap! This operation is not in the habit of hiring just any old sod who applies, you have to show me you have some builder experience and knowledge. I'll hire you if you can answer some questions."" The Irishman says, ""Deadly! I been a builder for donkey's years, Holy joe. let's have it, then, i'll show you i'm not a dosser!"" The foreman thinks to himself, ""Righto, this geezer's a lota wind. let's send him packing"". So he asks: ""Alright, what's the difference between a Girder and a Joist?"" The irishman thinks for a few seconds and grumbles a bit. He pauses long enough for the Englishman to get a bit of a smirk on his face (as English are wont to do). Finally, he takes a breath, sucks in his gut, and stands a little straighter to answer: ""One wrote Faust, the other wrote Finnegan's Wake!""",human,byrerc,11,1560127660,0,1179,1179,218,4.408256880733945,12
"The Husband Store

A new store that sells new husbands has opened in New York City , where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates: You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building! So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs. She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads: Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids. ""That's nice,"" she thinks, ""but I want more."" So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads: Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking. ""Wow,"" she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads: Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework. ""Oh, mercy me!"" she exclaims, ""I can hardly stand it!"" Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak. She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads: Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. PLEASE NOTE: To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street. The first floor has wives that love sex.

"Loooong, but maybe worth it.

A woman is pregnant in her teens...finally gives birth to two healthy twin boys. She’s young, and destitute, and knows she can’t take care of them or provide for them, and after a bit of soul searching she makes the heartbreaking decision to give the two boys up for adoption. Over the years she kept track of the twins; one was adopted by a well-to-do family in Dubai. They named him Amahl; they own an exporting conglomerate and her son would never want for anything, and was given the best education a man could ever need, and access to resources that she could never dream of. The other twin was adopted by a family in Mexico who name him Juan. The family owns a lot of land and runs a huge produce operation that ships their products all around the globe. As wrenching as that heartbreaking decision was years ago, she was relieved to know that her boys grew up to be healthy young men with all the life opportunities in front of them that she could in no way have provided. They’re living beautiful lives, and that thought provided her with some some small consolation over the years. Fast forward 25 years later. The young girl is now a happily married woman... but there hasn’t been a day since she gave those boys up for adoption that she hasn’t thought of them. And one day, she receives a letter from Juan. He had tracked her down and sent her a letter, and he included a recent picture of himself. He wrote that some day maybe he would try to visit. And she cried and cried and cried. She told her husband the story of the beautiful twin boys that she had given birth to such a long time ago; the story that she had hidden from him for all that time...the shame she felt, and the years of longing that only a heartbroken mother could know, or endure.

Bob Hill and his new wife, Betty, are vacationing in Europe, near Transylvania. They re driving in a rental car along a rather deserted highway. It is late, raining very hard and Bob can barely see the road in front of the car. Suddenly, the car skids out of control. Bob attempts to control it, but to no avail.

Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to get her medical assistance. He carefully picks her up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light and heads towards it, which is coming from a large, old house. He approaches the door and knocks. A small, hunched man opens the door.\n\nBob blurts, “Hello, my name is Bob Hill and this is my wife Betty. We’ve been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been Seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone?”\n\n “I’m sorry,” replies the hunchback, “but we don’t have a phone. My master is a doctor. Come in, and I will get him.”\n\nBob brings his wife in.\n\n An older man comes down the stairs. “I’m afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor; I am a scientist. However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had some basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory.”\n\nWith that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab. Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table.\n\nAfter a brief examination, Igor’s master looks worried. “Things are serious, Igor. Prepare a transfusion.” Igor and his master work feverishly, but to no avail. Bob and Betty Hill are no more.\n\nThe Hills’ deaths upsets Igor’s master greatly. Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. It is here that he has always found solace and he begins to play. A stirring, almost haunting melody fills the house.\n\nMeanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up.

"The Husband Store

A new store that sells new husbands has opened in New York City , where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:\n\nYou may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!\n\nSo, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:\n\nFloor 1 - These men Have Jobs.\n\nShe is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:\n\nFloor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.\n\n\""That's nice,\"" she thinks, \""but I want more.\"" So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:\n\nFloor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.\n\n\""Wow,\"" she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:\n\nFloor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.\n\n\""Oh, mercy me!\"" she exclaims, \""I can hardly stand it!\"" Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:\n\nFloor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.\n\nShe is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:\n\nFloor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n\nTo avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.\n\nThe first floor has wives that love sex.\n\nThe second floor has wives that love sex and have money and like beer.\n\nThe third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.",ai,ai_79,0,0,1,1989,1989,344,4.781976744186046,19

"Once upon a time there lived a young monk named Sam

His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n\nSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n\nAnd on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...\n\nAnd the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n\nAnd on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n\nSuddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.\n\nThe townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.\n\nThe mayor approached the lead monk of the order. \""What happened?\"" he asked, exasperated.\n\nThe old monk shook his head sadly. \""Isn't it obvious?\"" he said. \""Sam sung Note 7.\""",ai,ai_3454,0,0,1,2470,2470,425,4.811764705882353,33

"Wait for it

So there's a farm. On this farm, there's a cow, a chicken, and a horse, and the three of them are best friends. They do just about everything together. And one day, they're sitting at the window of the house, and the farmer's kid is watching MTV, and they're watching it, and they hear the music, and the horse says ""you know what? I'm gonna learn how to do that."" So the horse calls up Guitar Center, and he says to the guy on the phone, ""Hey, listen. I wanna learn to play guitar."" Guy on the phone says ""no problem. Come on down."" ""No, there might be one problem. I'm a horse."" ""Naw, it ain't a problem. We'll get some attachments, I can teach you to play. Promise."" So horse turns out to be a natural. He gets GOOD. And he calls over Cow and Chicken and he's like ""LOOK WHAT I CAN DO"" and he jams out like Jimi Hendrix. And Cow says ""holy shit. That's awesome. I want to learn to do something like that too. What's like that?"" And horse says ""Bass. Learn to play bass."" So Cow calls up Guitar Center, and she says ""Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play bass guitar."" Guy on the phone says ""No problem, miss, come on down."" ""Eh, this might be a problem. I'm a cow."" ""Nah, no problem. I helped a horse recently, I can teach you to play too. Promise."" So Cow learns to play the bass, and Cow is fucking amazing at it. So Cow and Horse are jamming, and Chicken gets a bit jealous. He says ""Damn, I wanna learn something too. But not like that."" Horse says ""Well, I mean, we need a drummer around here."" So Chicken calls up Guitar Center, and he says ""Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play drums."" Guy on the phone says ""No problem, man. Come on down."" ""Eh, maybe a problem. I'm a chicken."" ""Naw. Ain't no thing. I taught a horse guitar and a cow bass. I can teach you drums."" So chicken learns the drums, and he's fucking amazing. So Cow, Horse, and Chicken all start having jam sessions whenever the farmer's out. And one day they're playing, and a big record agent is driving down the road. And he hears them, and he's like ""what the fuck? that sounds amazing."" so he stops at the farm, and he finds them all playing in the barn. And he says ""Holy shit. You guys sound AWESOME.

We'll delay the first show a couple of days, so fly back home, spend some time with her, and then jump on a plane and come meet us."" Horse says ""Thanks, guys. you're the best,"" and he takes off. Couple of days later, Horse's mom is just fine. Turned out to be a real bad cold, she gets over it, and he spends another night there. The following morning, he gets a call. It's his agent.

"All his life, Harry wanted to be a cable-car operator...

... so one day he enrolled in cable-car operator school in New York. He was a fair student, but not great, and after several years of study, he graduated with a C average and was assigned as part of a job-placement program to a route in Manhattan. He loved his new job and everything was great for a while until one day he wasn't paying very close attention and lost control of his cable-car. It hopped its track and careened off of a pier into the Hudson River. All of his passengers were killed but Harry managed to swim back to shore. He was terrified of what would happen so he fled the scene (and, eventually, the city) before police and rescue crews could arrive.\n\nHe settled in Houston under an assumed name and took a job in a grocery store, trying to keep as low a profile as possible. He lived a quiet life, and every day he would watch the Houston cable-cars going up and down the street and he longed for what he had lost. One day, he decided that he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school again, this time in Houston and under his new name. He did a little better this time, having been through the classwork before, and graduated with a B average and was assigned to a nice route in La Porte. His passengers loved him and he loved his job. But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable car. It hopped its track and ended up in Trinity Bay. All of his passengers were killed, but Harry managed to swim back to shore. Fearing that authorities would put this accident together with the one in New York, he again fled the scene.\n\nThis time he ended up in San Francisco with yet another assumed name. He figured that, if he couldn't operate his beloved cable cars (for fear of getting caught), he could at least see them everywhere he went, as San Francisco is the cable-car capital of the world. This satisfied him for a little while, but eventually he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school yet again. He excelled in his classwork this time around (having been through the program twice before) and graduated magna cum laude. He was assigned the highly-coveted Market Street route and drove it for quite a while without incident. But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable-car. It hopped its tracks and ended up in the San Francisco Bay. All of his passengers were killed and as Harry swam back to shore, the police were waiting for him.\n\nIn the subsequent investigation and trial, prosecutors put all the pieces together. They figured that he was the same guy who killed all those people in Houston and New York. It was the trial of the century and at the end of it, Harry was sentenced to die in the electric chair for his crimes (the actions having been deemed so egregiously willful and persistent as to constitute premeditation). He was transferred to Alcatraz to await his execution. He was a model prisoner, never causing any trouble, and every day he woke and did exactly 52 jumping jacks and 52 sit-ups and 52 push-ups in his cell to keep himself occupied. The day before his scheduled execution, the warden came to him and asked what he would like for his last meal. Harry thought about it for a minute and said “I would like a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk”. The warden stared blankly at him. “Harry,” he said, “we have access to the best chefs in the world. This is your last meal, and you can have anything you want. Steak, lobster, name it!” Harry shook his head and repeated his request for a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk. His disgusting meal was brought to him and he wolfed it down hungrily. The next day, his head was shaved and last rites were administered, and Harry was led to the electric chair and hooked up. At the appointed time, prison guards threw the switch and counted to ten before turning off the current to the chair. But Harry was fine. Smoldering a bit at the spots where the contacts met his skin, perhaps, but otherwise the picture of health.\n\nFlummoxed, the guards took Harry back to his cell and began the long process of checking and rechecking their equipment for malfunctions, but they couldn’t find anything. A new execution date was set for one month later, and Harry went back to his morning exercise routine of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups to keep his mind and body occupied while he waited.\n\nThe eve of his second execution arrived and the warden visited Harry again to take the order for his last meal. “A rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk,” Harry said. The warden just shook his head and asked him Harry was sure, then arranged to have his meal brought to him. The next day, guards shaved his head again, Harry was administered his last rites again, and he was marched to the electric chair and hooked up again. This time, though, they weren’t taking any chances. At the appropriate time, they threw the switch and left the juice flowing for a full minute. And when they were finished, Harry was just fine.\n\nThe warden was nervous. A little known California law stipulated that the state could only make three attempts to execute a prisoner, and if that failed they had to let him go. Harry was returned to his cell where he resumed his daily morning exercise regimen of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups. Another month passed, and on the eve of his third execution, Harry was visited by the warden, who just said “let me guess” as he wheeled in a cart with a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk. Harry thanked him politely and ate his dinner. The next morning, they shaved his head (AGAIN!) and delivered last rites (AGAIN!) and marched him to the execution chamber, where he was hooked up (AGAIN!) to the electric chair. This time, prison officials weren’t taking any chances. The entire Bay Area power grid was diverted to Alcatraz. They threw the switch (cutting electricity to millions of customers) and left the juice running for a full half hour. The execution chamber buzzed with the awesome power being fed into the chair. You could taste the ions in the air. And when they turned off the power….\n\nHarry was just fine. The warden shook his head in disbelief. “Well, Harry,” he said, “we have to let you go. California law stipulates that we can only make three attempts at an execution. But before I do, I really have to know. How did you survive three executions? Was it the jumping jacks, the sit-ups, and the push-ups? Was it the rotten banana, rotten apple, and spoiled milk? What IS your secret?”\n\nHarry just shook his head and shrugged, “I guess I’m just not a very good conductor.”",ai,ai_2227,0,0,1,6773,6773,1216,4.5699013157894735,69

However they were terrible!\n\r\n“This isn’t how it’s supposed to sound!” The musician shouted at the orchestra, but the great leader was displeased and he called for the musician to be put to death.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at the execution, the musician was asked what he’d like for his final meal.\r\n\r\n“I’d like a piping hot curry”, said the musician.\r\n\r\nAfter eating his curry, the hottest curry he’d eaten in a long time, he sat in the electric chair and awaited his fate.\r\n\r\nThe switch was thrown, sparks flew across the room and the air filled with smoke... But nothing happened, the musician was unharmed.\r\n\r\nHaving witnessed this miracle, An awe struck Kim Jong-Un decided to give the musician another chance to impress him with his music.\r\n\r\nHe got straight to work, writing another piece of music, this time, his masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe night came, and he stood in front of his orchestra as they completely murdered his piece of music.\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t supposed to sound anything like that, nothing at all!” he exclaimed, but Kim Jong-Un isn’t the forgiving type and he sent the musician straight to the execution chamber.\r\n\r\nAgain, the guards asked him what he wanted for his final meal. This time the musician asked for a curry hot enough to burn his eyes out.\r\n\r\nHe chomped down the curry, teary eyed and sweating, then was strapped to the chair. Again they threw the switch and again the musician remained unaffected.\r\n\r\nDumbfounded, the great leader said, “One last chance to prove your worth”, amazed that this man was actually still alive!\r\n\r\nThe night of the third composition came, this time it was going to work, “surely this is the most masterful piece of music ever written” thought the musician.\r\n\r\nFor the third time, the orchestra failed to play the music to how the musician had written it and yet again he was sent to the execution chamber, with Kim Jong-Un himself set to throw the switch.\r\n\r\nHis final meal request was for the hottest curry ever made on this planet.\r\n\r\n“No” said the great leader, I've had it with you and your super hot curries. We’re putting you straight in the chair this time, no final meal, you’re not walking out of here unharmed”\r\n\r\nThe musician was strapped in, the switch thrown by none other than Kim Jong-Un himself. Sparks flew, smoke bloomed an yet the man yet again was unharmed!\r\n\r\nThe great leader stood there, speechless.\r\n\r\nThe musician looked at him and said, “Oh, the curries had nothing to do with it, I’m just a terrible conductor.”",ai,ai_6196,0,0,1,2952,2952,480,5.15,27

When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried.

"A town has banned music, and a monastery has popped up dedicated to worship in chorus.

The town's police were at the gates of the monastery every night, however the brother of the town's mayor was part of the monks, and used his connection to his brother to stop the police from interrupting their choral ceremonies. After a year long stalemate, a man named Hugh came to the town, and decided to run for mayor. The race was close, but the townspeople were tired of listening to the monks chorus in the late nights, and decided that their current mayor would not stop them. The same day he won, Hugh had demanded the monks cease singing, or else he would have to take extreme measures.

"As I type this, I am slowly dying of cancer. This is my story, and I hope whoever reads this takes this as a warning.

I was never one of the cool kids. Ever since I was born I have been, if no better way to put it, average. My mother used to tell me the story of when I was born. Apparently, when I first popped out, I didn't cry, as one would expect a newborn baby to. I simply peered around a bit as the nurses rushed over to take care of me. How's that \""average\""? I don't know. It's just a story my mom used to tell me, and I think it sets the stage rather well for what was to come.\n\nThe days of my innocence flew by, and soon I was about to enter 9th grade. That was when my dad was posted to a new state by his company. Leaving behind my home of nearly 14 years, I stepped into the brave new world of Mississippi. Of course, that meant I enrolled in a new high school. There, lost and alone, I stumbled around until I met my two guys who would become the best friends I would ever have.\n\nTo cut a long story short, I got to know them in math class. Bored by a particularly dry lecture (something about calculus) we struck a conversation and found that we shared a common interest: We were all crazy into gaming. We talked about the newest Metal Gear, and it all went uphill from there.\n\nTheir names were Luke and Missile. Luke was a bit of a nerd, but an all-round cool guy, and an amazing friend. If you were in a jam, you could be sure Luke would be there to see you through. Missile, on the other hand, was a wild one; always on the move, and with such an excited and bubbly manner of speaking you could feel yourself getting carried along as he spoke. At first, I thought he was Latino, but turns out he was half-filipino. Oh, and his real name was Gonzales. He just liked being called \""Missile\"" (for whatever reason, I do not know. I doubt even he himself really does).\n\nSo it was with these two that I spent a happy 6 months in high school. My parents seemed to be happy that I was coping well. We lived in a good neighborhood, and our next-door neighbor, a German fellow by the name of Mr Anderson who always wore sunglasses and had a pot belly, would often invite us over for barbecues and such. Luke and Missile would join in on occasion, and we would talk about life, school, and anything really, before popping in Mario Party in Mr Anderson's Wii and playing to our heart's content. Life was going pretty well.\n\nThen, I met her. Her name was Trucy, and I will forever remember the day I first laid my eyes on her. It was in art class, and amidst the smell of stale paint and canvas I caught a whiff of perfume. I looked up, and there she was. Beautiful brown curls framed her perfect, blue-eyed face. And that smile. Oh god. I swear I collaped into a dreamy, unmanly heap on the table for the entire lesson which followed.\n\nWhen I met up with Luke and Missile in the cafeteria, my thoughts still dwelled on her. Luke must have sensed that something was going on, because he waved his hand in front of me, saying \""Earth to Arlon, Earth to Arlon, Arlon do you copy\"", which snapped me out of my trance-like state. \""What's with you man?\"" he asked. \""You're not your usual self today.\""\n\n\""Oh, Nothing.\"" I lied.\n\nBut, of course, they found out eventually. And they were really cool about it. Turns out, Missile knew Trucy from Economics, so with that in mind, we started to brainstorm ideas on how to approach her. Luke suggested we take it slow. \""What about you 'invite' us all to the movies, Missile?\"" he said. \""We'll book tickets, then get trucy next to Arlon. We can work it out from there.\""\n\nWe did exactly that, and it turned out pretty well. Better, in fact, than I expected -- we managed to exchange phone numbers. Missile and Luke congratulated me on a job well done, then we went to get Taco Bell. There, we planned our next course of action.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Trucy and I got to know each other, whether through phone calls or the clandestine operations Luke and Missile helped me arrange. Soon, I didn't need their help anymore, and we went on our first date together at a park (yes, very creative I know). It was then that I knew I had to tell her.\n\n\""Trucy?\""\n\n\""Yes Arlon?\""\n\n\""There's something... i need to tell you.\""\n\n\""What is it?\""\n\nI hesitated. Then, I saw them. Sitting on a bench reading newspapers. Cheeky bastards, turns out they had arranged this too? Luke smiled and gave me a thumbs-up while Missile mouthed \""Just do it.\"" So I did it.\n\n\""I... I kinda like you, hehe\"" (it probably sounded even more awkward than it does here)\n\n\""Oh, Arlon\""\n\nAnd we shared our first kiss. I was in heaven.\n\nMy heaven would last through the three years we dated. Then, just when I thought our relationship was truly budding, we broke up. Yes, it was that abrupt. Trucy loved someone else now, and I was left behind.\n\nThe feeling in my chest that I experienced that day, cannot be described in words. Suffice to say, I was devastated, heartbroken. I went home the day she broke up with me without speaking a word to anyone. When I got home, I shut the door and tried to rationalise with myself.\n\n\""It's ok Arlon. You'll manage. There are plenty other girls out there\""\n\n\""Don't be sad Arlon. it was not meant to be.\""\n\nBut the more I thought about it, the worse I felt. Over the next few days, Luke and Missile tried to talk me out of it, tried to make me forget it, get it over with. But it did not help. I slipped further and further into depression. Yes, I started hanging out late and doing drugs. Yes, I started doing alcohol. I went from respectable, generally nice guy to a coke-snorting, chain-smoking hobo. But through all this, Luke and Missile stood by me. Shame on me that I didn't appreciate them then. I remember once, I, in a drunken stupor, smashed a bottle and used it to stab Missile, who was trying to stop me from drinking so much ( and probably get alcohol poisoning).\n\nThat was the end of it between me and Missile.\n\nI tried committing suicide once. I climbed to the top of the roof and jumped down. I got caught in some tree branches and ended up on the ground with only a gash across my leg. I cursed the heavens loudly for letting me survive. Mr Anderson, alerted by the noise, quickly brought me in and wrapped up my wound. I sobbed as he picked up the phone to dial my parents, who were at work.\n\nA year later, I saw Trucy outside a bar with her new boyfriend. I couldn't control myself and rushed up to them.\n\""YOU RUINED MY LIFE!\""\n\nThe two of them were taken by surprise and the boyfriend raised his fist.\n\n\""YOU TOOK HER FROM ME\"" I yelled. \""YOU TOOK MY LIFE FROM ME!\"" and I swung wildly at him. Suddenly, there was an excruciating pain in my abdomen. I screamed, then I collapsed.\n\nNext thing I remember seeing was the cold, sterile hospital ceiling. I awoke to find Luke, Trucy and my parents by my side, her boyfriend leaning against the wall.\n\nThe doctor came in, and revealed to me that I had a tumor in my liver. I started to cry. I had wasted my life, all my potential, over one stupid breakup. Why did I start doing drugs? Why did I start doing alcohol?\n\n\""It should be okay,\"" the doctor said. \""But we'll need to monitor it for a while to look for any unusual developments. Rest now, ok?\""\n\nMy tears turned into those of joy. It was like being born again. I had a second chance. It was time to turn over a new leaf.\n\nAt the advice of Mr Anderson, my parents put aside their pride and hired a professional counsellor to guide me through the tough times. I also had to take antidepressants. But I was getting better. Trucy agreed that she had handled the breakup badly, and we promised to keep in touch, if only just as friends.\nI would laze in the couch feeling a little blue. Today, I was feeling it a little more than usual. I started playing Metal Gear Soild V half-heartedly to take my mind off it, when the doorbell rang. It was Luke.\n\n\""Came to visit,\"" he said. \""How are things?\""\n\n\""Oh, they're alright.\""\n\nWe chatted for a while. Then he said. \""Cheer up, old sport. Here, have a look at this, figured you would find it funny.\"" He whipped out his iPhone 6 and opened up 4chan.\nAnd that's how I got cancer.",ai,ai_7123,0,0,1,8279,8279,1515,4.464686468646865,131

"Airport Drinks.

Paddy and his long time friend Shamus finally scored a job at Heathrow airport as tarmac broom operators. Problem was it was night shift and it was seriously cutting into their drinking habits. That was until a Concorde landed and was taxied over to where they were working, and obviously Paddy had to go have a look and ended up under the wings. He called Shamus over after he noticed a slight smell and a dripping noise, Paddy ended up tracking it down to a leaking fuel tank and stood directly under the drip hoping to catch a bit in his hand. But Shamus took that exact moment to nudge him and Paddy got a big splash right onto his tongue. To say it caught him by surprise was like saying the Irish don’t drink. Shamus was shocked when Paddy screwed up his face and turned a horrible shade of white, ‘Begorrah that’s got a kick like a mule!’ Yelled Paddy. Well Shamus not to be outdone grabbed the mop bucket nearby and waited patiently until it had a few millimetres inside and skulled the precious fluid. He immediately tried to bring his hands up to his neck as his throat constricted but found them forced back by some invisible force.

It’s Paddy and I’m not sure where I am, are you alright laddie?’ Asked Paddy. Shamus half heard him and couldn’t stop staring at his nose, but he replied, ‘Paddy, what happened to us? This is the work of the devil, I have a nose I can use for spear and I’m sure the nurses here painted me white!’ Paddy calmed him down and replied, ‘Twas the rocket fuel we drunk last night, you started running up and down the runway and flapping your arms and tried to rape a Cessna ya silly bugger!’ ‘Well, I seem to remember you doing circles and started talking French, but where are you Paddy?’ Asked Shamus. ‘Last thing I remember was sitting on the airport throne with a cigarette and had to seriously fart and then a bright white light appeared!’ Paddy exclaimed, ‘ Now I have two French policeman and an airforce pilot claiming I violated airspace over Lyons!’",human,evn8pq,1,1580306448,0,2389,2389,442,4.404977375565611,16

"Man in desperate need for a pee

A man is caught short on the high street, in desperate need of a piss. He finally finds a public toilet and rushes in. He see's there are 3 urinals, the left and right are taken so he bounds for the one in the middle. But as he begins to pee, it doesn't come out as uniformly as expected, but instead sprays all over the place like a fountain. After somehow talking himself out of a beating from the now dampened men either side of him, he apologises and tells them he's going to go to a doctor to see what the hell is going on. After the humiliation of telling the doctor what has happened, he now has to get his penis out for the doctor to inspect it. To both their surprise, they see that it is riddled with holes. the doctor tells him he has never seen anything like it in his entire career, and hands over a card with a number on it. The man asks, ""oh, is this some sort of specialist?"" ""not exactly"" replies the doctor. ""He teaches the flute.

Radio Yerevan answered: In principle, yes. In the USA, you can stand in front of the Washington Monument, shout ""Down with Reagan!"" and you wouldn't get punished. In the USSR, you can stand in the middle of the Red Square, shout ""Down with Reagan!"" and you won't get punished, either. --- Radio Yerevan was asked: What is chaos? Radio Yerevan answered: We do not comment on national economics. --- Radio Yerevan was asked: Why is there no flour in the market? Radio Yerevan answered: Because they began adding it to bread. --- Radio Yerevan was asked: What is a Soviet musical duet? Radio Yerevan answered: A Soviet musical quartet after a trip abroad. --- Radio Yerevan was asked: Why is our government not in hurry to land men on the moon? Radio Yerevan answered: Because they might decide to not return. --- Radio Yerevan was asked: What is ""Russian business""? Radio Yerevan answered: To steal a crate of vodka, sell it, and then drink the money away. --- Radio Yerevan was asked: Was comrade Lenin a scientist or a politician?

"Dog pun run [long]

Shamelessly copying puns from the Bugle podcast; \n\nI bet Lou Reed’s wife couldn’t believe it when he broke the news to her that they were going to do this concert. I mean, she mastiff had to pinch-‘er self.\n\n“Concert for dogs now Lou? I know you’re avant-garde but what’s the pointer that?”\n\nBut Lou Reed soon set-'er straight. He said “Sch-nau-zer’s a time and a place for complaining; this is a great opportunity for us dear. I terrier, we can’t basset up! I’ll put a band together and whippet into shape.”\n\n“Okay” she said, “But make sure it’s a cosmopolitan band. Get an English guy on drums and someone from Tehran on rhythm guitars…”\n\n“Hang on love, I’ll just write that down: Pom, Iranian. Anyone else?”\n\n“Yup. For backing vocals get the lead singer from that influential synth-pop band Kraftwerk. And, er, maybe the famous American actress and occasional singer who starred in Moonlighting.”\n\n“Okay, German, Shepard.”\n\n“And on drums…”\n\n“Hang on” interrupted Lou Reed, “Dachshund-ough.”\n\nThe preparations then began and they started to pack their bags. Lou said “Oh no, I can’t find that lovely knitted sweater I bought when I did that gig in Dublin.”\n\nLaurie, his wife, soon located it, “here it is Lou, Irish-wool-found. By the way, did you find our annoying neighbour's skillet that you borrowed?”\n\n“Fucking Carl’s-pan.-Yeah-I’ll take it ‘round later.”\n\n“Make sure him or his misses is there when you give it back, Dal-make-sure-no one’ll say we’ve still got it.”\n\nSoon Laurie was ready to go, “H-Okay,-do-you mind if I tell my friend? You know the lady from number 35, who you really don’t like.”\n\n“What, shit-Sue?”\n\n“I wish you wouldn’t call her that dear. It’s very rude. And anyway, why don’t you like her?”\n\n“Well, ‘cause she talks rot-while-her huge husband scares me. I mean he’s a big-old bastard. Last time I told her about one of my gigs she just talked about it endlessly at work; she really bored-her-colleagues.”\n\nThey climbed into their car to go to the airport to Australia.\n\n“Wow” said Laurie “I’ve had such a great day ‘n’-it’s-only still lunchtime.\n\n“Hang on” said Lou suddenly, “we better do some publicity for this gig. Can I borrow 20 bucks for some posters for it?”\n\n“Sure-pay-me back next week” replied his wife, “and get me a box of chocolates to say thanks. My purse is on the backseat, I’ll just reach-back and get it.\""\n\n“Have you told any of your old music buddies about it? Has-Keith Richards called?”\n\n“No” said Lou, “but I told ex-Velvet’s drummer Maureen Tucker all about it. I really talked it up.”\n\n“Did-you-wow-‘er?”\n\n“I sure did wow her; She was well impressed” said Lou. “I’m so excited about this gig.

This-a last thing I wanted to see.”\n\nAs they pulled into the airport, they drove past a textile maker who’d fallen into the icy Hudson River and just climbed out.\n\n“Look darling,” said Lou Reed, “it’s a cold-and-wet-weaver.”\n\nAndy Zaltzman; total: 31 dog puns",ai,ai_4906,0,0,1,3595,3595,582,5.176975945017182,46

"The Last Ride

""Congratulations! You can now handle this route on your own. Remember the company's protocol"", Bobbie beamed as he finished assessing Dave's performance for Bus Service 13. ""Enjoy the night events following the route"", Bobbie mischievously hinted at Dave, his junior who had just joined the company. Today, Dave steeled his nerves. He will be on his own, handling the midnight ""last bus"" schedule for Service 13, a long but important service, as it serviced a massive industrial area. Of course it's a bustling service in the day, with workers to and fro. As part of regulation, the company has to operate the service even till midnight where there's usually no passengers. Oddly, his only assignment will be to drive this service at this timing, and nothing else. Noone else in the company was jealous of his work but Dave cast aside those thoughts. Satisfied with the initial inspection of the double-decker bus, he started on his journey from the depot. With only the scenes of forest edges flying by, he examined quiet roads and empty pathways but an eerie feeling crept up as he passed a dilapidated graveyard. The government planned to exhume the site to pave way for more industrial projects, or at least that was what he had read in the papers. Approaching the start of the industrial area, he wondered if there'll be anyone boarding the bus. As expected, there was noone in the multitude of bus-stops he passed. As the last few factories loomed before him, he noticed someone at a bus-stop. It was an old lady, dressed simply in a white dress, her dishevelled hair blocking her face, but two things were apparent. She held out her hand flagging the bus but her eyes were transfixed on something above. Specifically, the upper deck of the bus. Dave slowed down, feeling slightly nervous and as he approaches, the figure maintained her position but her gaze never strayed. Confident that the person was physically there, he stopped and the woman boarded, her face distraught. ""I have never seen so many people up there at this time, it must be because today's Friday the 13th"", she shivered. Dave was dumbfounded as she took her seat beside the stairwell leading to the upper deck. Indeed today was Friday 13th as he eyed the woman through the rear view mirror. She was 5 seats away from him but her fear was contagious. Dave had goosebumps as he pulled off. ""I'm sorry madam, but what do you mean people up there? You're the first passenger"", Dave inquired, trying to quench his curiousity. ""Nothing nothing! I can hear them stomping above as though they're trying to shush me"", the woman squeaked as she clasped her hand in prayer. Dave was mortified. He kept looking at the CCTV monitor panel but there was noone in the upper decks. His fear was somewhat relieved as they entered the residential zone and 13 stops later, the woman buzzed the stop. Dave couldn't believe his eyes when the woman ran fleeing out of the bus at her stop. Her face displayed pure agony as she turned back for the last time to look at the bus before disappearing into the shadows of the houses. Dave controlled his breathing and continued driving. It was only a few stops away till the final depot, so he must see this journey to the end. Still, he kept peeking at the CCTV monitors to be sure but nothing happened as he ended his work for the day. Dave didn't tell anyone what happened as he turned up for work the next day. Perhaps it was an anomaly, there was no point in looking like a mad man after just a day's work. He checked the bus and headed out for the journey. The same start as yesterday and again at the same stop, there appeared the lady again. She looked the same, save for her change of clothes but still her gaze was transfixed on the upper deck. ""Today's less busy... but there's a hulking presence amongst them"", she whispered as she sat further way from Dave, nearer the exit doors. Chill went down his spine. Was there a murderous intent above that he didn't notice? He scanned the monitors just to be safe but he couldn't see anything. Even Dave who didn't believe in the supernatural, was starting to question his beliefs, as he noticed the woman sobbing in her seat. As if a replay of last night's activities, the woman sprung out and ran when they reached her stop. She didn't even look back. These series of events repeated themselves as Dave drove the service for more than a year. He thought he could get used to it but he just couldn't. Different nights, different terrors. It has gotten to the point that the woman now regularly sat on the exit door steps, clutching to the walls, sniffling her cries. ""There's something on the roof"", ""I can hear them trying to go down the stairwells"", ""Stop looking into the upper deck, they're restless"", ""We're damned in this service"", ""I hope you're praying as hard as me, it's the only way to resist"", ""Stop crying and wailing, stop! Stop, I can't help you!!!"", ""God bless me please!"", all manners of horrified speeches were said by the woman, either directed to him or to the dwelling above. ""I pray you are safe!"", ""God bless your soul"", ""Be safe"", sometimes she would say that to Dave before she alighted. Dave hated it when she said parting words because it hinted a terrifying presence. And then one day it stopped. The lady stopped appearing. The same day the government had also begun exhuming the sites and transferring the remains to another mortuary. Dave rue the day he started noticing her absence. She was the only company he had in this damned service route. He kept checking the CCTV above, afraid of the unknown. He started praying from the moment he start the journey. He brought books of faith, talisman, charms and even turned to vegetarian diet to rid himself of bad karma. But whatever he did, the pressure behind him grew and grew. Without the woman, things had started to go awry. He didn't notice them at first but he thought he could start seeing the negativities himself. Flickers in the CCTV monitor, he felt the temperature drop, opposing cars high beamed him, and it started to affect his driving. He would narrowly avoid collision with structures while checking the monitors. He would unconciously speed up and beat red lights when in the vicinity of the violated graveyard. 2 months of this has taken a toll on Dave. He had nightmares every night, images of dark shadows consuming the interior of the bus. In just the short period, Dave had lost a lot of weight, he looked gaunt and his eyes lifeless. His concerned wife pulled him aside and just said she loved him, their children loved him, and if work was the reason he had become like this, he should find another job. Dave spent the morning thinking about this. The job paid well since it was night hours, it was only 1 route and he had never fell ill in the past year, despite his horror experiences. It was only after the lady disappeared that things have taken a physical toll on him. He concluded that she was part of his divine protection. He had made up his mind. He will tender his resignation. In front of his superiors, Dave explained his reasons for quitting. He didn't care if they didn't believed him, and he even turned down their offer for a raise. They must know something, that must be why they want to keep me. Without anyone else wanting to run the midnight bus service 13, the company could face a legal repercussion. In the end, they had to call back Bobbie, the only person who had drove that route before Dave. In fact, Bobbie drove exclusively that route for more than a decade, never taking a day off. Dave took his leave and lo and behold, he met Bobbie outside the office. Bobbie exlaimed his surprise, ""I heard you're resigning? But why?"" ""I couldn't continue working that route after the only passenger, this lady, I don't know anything about her, but after she stopped apeparing, I just don't have the will to continue"", Dave said. ""That's... a damn shame! She was the only reason why I had agreed to come back! My ailing eyesight was why the company transferred me to day shift. But if I had a choice, I would have stayed on service 13! But now that she's gone... it's all over"", Bobbie wept. Bobbie continued hopelessly, ""Now who's gonna accompany me in that night ride..."". ""I understand what you meant Bobbie. In hindsight, she was also the reason why I stayed. She was my protector, my guardian angel"", Dave sighed. ""What the fuck are you talking about?"", quizzed Bobbie suddenly. Dave told his stories to a bewildered Bobbie, who kept quiet the whole time. ""That foxy vixen... I guess she must have retired from her company"" mumbled Bobbie. Noticing the shocked look plastered on Dave's face. Bobbie chuckled, ""I guess she'll really do anything to avoid paying the bus fare"".",human,8dc6qj,1,1524113746,0,8769,8769,1558,4.628369704749679,101

A man lived right on the US side of the border between US and Mexico. One day his house caught on fire. He called 911, the operator said it would take the fire department 30 minutes to get there. Panicking, he drove across the border, found the Mexican fire department and offered them $10,000 if they put out the fire.

"The New York Philharmonic was conducting a rendition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony

If you are not familiar with Beethoven's 9th Symphony it's a tremendous piece of work, but the bass line is atrocious. Not because it is complicated, but because it goes like this: **""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""** And then approximately an hour an a half later it goes like this: **""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""** And then there's a round of applause and everyone take their bows and and exits stage right. The conductor had a great idea though, and the basses practiced this in the weeks leading up to the concert. The would play their first note **""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""** And then they would quietly lay down their basses on provided carpets, and exit the stage - waiting patiently to return an hour and a half later to play their final note: **""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""** The night of the concert arrives, everyone is dressed to the nines (as is appropriate of course). The basses are shined and everyone is relaxed and ready. The conducter taps on his conducter's stand to get attention, raises his hands and with a gallant downstroke the basses play the ever living shit out of their note **""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""** And then quietly lay down their instruments on the provided carpets and step behind the curtain. This is where things go awry, ""Hey guys,"" says the lead bass ""I have a great idea. There's a bar across the street and we have at least an hour and a half before we play our next note. Let's slip across and have a couple pints!"" Everyone thinks this is a fantastic idea, so the entire section hops along to the bar and downs a couple pints. One of the second basses after a while gets a little conserned and asks the lead bass if it was time to go back. ""No, we got time. See, I tied a string to the last page of the conductors score attached to a transciever. When he gets to that section I'll get a buzz on my phone and we can head back."" Everyone thinks that this is brilliant so they knock back a few more pints before suddenly the lead bass stands up and announces it's time to go. They bounce back across the street, through the musicians entrance, and up to the curtain to peek through and sure enough, they're right on time. So they slip through, pick up their instruments and look up at the conductor and...he is angry. Super angry. Ready to bust a blood vessel angry. But you would be too wouldn't you?

"Two brothers are walking in the countryside

They are on their way to their father, who needs help on his farm since he broke his leg. \n\nThe brothers, being from the city, are clearly bothered by all the cow poop. And it's all they can complain about for the entire trip. The older brother has to pee and in the meantime the younger brother sneakily puts some of the cow poop in a plastic bag. For a prank later.\n\nBut little did the little brother know that the big brother really didn't have to pee. He also filled a plastic bag with cow poop for a prank.\n\nSo when the big brother returns the two boys continue walking as if nothing happened.\n\nIn order to provoke the little brother about his upcoming prank, the big brother jokingly starts talking about \""Operation Poop\"". But without actually revealing that he is going to pull off a prank.\n\nThe Operation Poop thing becomes kind of an inside joke thing that the two brothers keep talking about, but without knowing of eachother that they both want to pull off a prank. \n\n20 minutes later, they arrived at the dad's house. Since there are no hospitals near where the dad lives and he does not own a telephone, the dad asks his sons if they want to try to find a good stick for him. So he can use the stick to walk with. The stick has to be very solid and the dad recommends the brothers to look for a specific kind of stick that is used to hold up fences, because they are usually made from strong wood, thick and give no splinters.\n\nSo the brothers start looking around for these kinds of sticks. They continued to talk about Operation Poop and eventually used the expression so often that they shortened it, so it can be said faster. Later on each went their own way so they don't look at the same spots all the time.\n\nAfter a while, the big brother finds a large sheet of paper with an advertisement sticked to a billboard. He decides that it could be useful for his prank. By wrapping the paper around the cow poop, he can make a \""poop bomb\"" that shreds when it hits somebody at a high velocity. Covering the person in poop. \n\nMeanwhile, the little brother finds the absolute perfect stick for his dad. It is dry, perfectly round and wonderfully has no pieces of barbed wire or nails in it like all the other similar sticks. But instead of taking it, he decides to cover one side entirely in cow poop, and lay that side on the ground. So when the big brother finds the stick, his hand will be completely covered.\n\nEventually the big brother finds the poop stick. He enthusiastically screams \""YES!!! It's perfect!\"". The little brother hears it and runs a little closer to witness his prank happening.\n\nThe big brother quickly grabs the stick without care. And the prank is successful. His hand is covered in poop. Disgusted, he shouts: \n\n\""This is a shitpost!\""\n\n.\n\nAfter a while he realized that the little brother did this as a prank. The poop has clear fingerprints on it. So the big brother angrily decides to execute \""Operation Poop\"" and throws his own prank bomb at the little brother. Right into his face.\n\nThe little brother, noticing what the object that just hit him was, shouted:\n\n\""OP is a shit poster!\""",ai,ai_2751,0,0,1,3211,3211,570,4.633333333333334,38

OK, so this family walks into a talent agency, it’s a mother, father, their son and daughter, and a little baby. The father says to the talent agent, “Sir, our family has an amazing act, we know if you would let us perform it for you, you would want to sign us.” And the talent agent says, “Sorry, we don’t sign family acts, they’re too cutesy.” But then the mother goes, “Please sir, if you just give us two minutes I know you’ll like our act.” So the talent agent says “Alright, ya got two minutes.” So the family jumps right into it. The mother smiles and points at the son who hits “play” on a boombox. Thrilling circus music starts to play as the father spins his daughter around, bends her over, lifts up her skirt, and starts licking her asshole. Then the son lays down on the floor and opens his mouth and the mother tears off tear-away pants, squats down over his face and starts shitting all over him. The father grabs the baby, takes off his diaper and starts sucking his cock. While the son, still with his mother’s shit in his mouth, goes over and licks the baby’s tiny little balls. Now the mother lays down on the floor while the daughter gets up high on a chair and starts pissing all over her. Then the father and son take the baby and start stuffing it head-first back into the mother’s vagina, while the daughter’s piss rains down on all of them. They get the baby halfway in, so that just its legs are sticking out all flailing around. The son takes the mother’s shit out of his mouth and starts rubbing it all over everyone, while the father sticks his cock in the baby’s asshole and fucks it while it’s still inside the mother, until he comes all over the baby, the wife, the son and the daughter. Then the father gets up and says “And now for our impersonation of the victims of 9/11.” The whole family starts running around the room screaming and laughing with their dicks and titties all flapping around covered with shit and piss and cum going “Aaaaugh!

In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com did take unto himself a healthy young wife by the name of Dorothy. And Dot Com was a comely woman, large of breast, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com.\n \nAnd she said unto Abraham, her husband, \""Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?\""\n \nAnd Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, \""How, dear?\""\n \nAnd Dot replied, \""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale, and they will reply telling you who hath the best price. The sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS).\""\n \nAbraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent.\n \nTo prevent neighboring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew. It was known as Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS), and she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures - Hebrew to the People (HTTP).\n \nAnd the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS. And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. Indeed he did insist on drums to be made that would work only with Brother Gates' drum heads and drumsticks.\n \nAnd Dot did say, \""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others.\"" And Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known. He said, \""We need a name that reflects what we are.\""\n \nAnd Dot replied, \""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.\"" \""YAHOO,\"" said Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot Com.\n \nAbraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic Educated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to locate things around the countryside.\n \nIt soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating Everything (GOOGLE).\n \nThat is how it all began.

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken."" ""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time."" Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar. Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow. ""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started."" ""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow."" ""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time."" Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going. One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!"" The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital. Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors. Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death. So the horse walks into a bar. The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""",human,7gqb4p,189,1512081605,0,3211,3211,614,4.229641693811075,57

"Once upon a time there lived a young monk named Sam

His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below. Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one. And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there. Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam. The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated. The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""",human,9doij9,28,1536277217,0,2440,2440,433,4.635103926096997,33

The other week I was in the aquarium having a whale of a time (pardon the pun). I saw sea horses, sharks, turtles, the whole shebang. But I couldn't wait to get to my favourite creature. I don't know why but I've always been fascinated by eels. I did a project on them in primary school and since then they've just stuck with me. I can name every single breed of them without even trying. So I get to the eel section which is crowded beyond belief. I mean I love eels but most people just kind of glance at them on the way to the stingrays. Today there were so many people there I couldn't even see the tank. I managed to push myself to the front, accidentally shoving a toddler, and saw what all the fuss was about. There they were, all swimming about, hidingin crevices, doing what eels do best. Except one. I couldn't actually believe it but right in the middle of the tank there was an eel. Biggest eel in there. And it was singing. Clear as day it was singing. I don't know how we were all hearing it through the glass and the water but we could see its mouth moving perfectly with the words. It even hummed some of the music at one point so I know it wasn't a trick. It only sang the one song though, this old love song that I can't remember the name of. It's really popular though,used in loads of movies, especially ones about Italy. I couldn't believe it, I'd never seen an eel do this before. I knew so much about eels and yet I'd never heard of this kind before. I managed to spot an employee on the other side of the room and struggled my way over. I somehow got his attention over the noise of all the people and the singing eel. ""How the hell does an eel know that song? How is it able to sing? What kind of eel is it?""

"A girl walks into a tattoo parlor and explains that she's always wanted a tattoo of her favorite country music star on the inside of her thigh...

She's really conflicted though, because she can't decide between her two favorites, Conway Twitty or George Jones. \n\nThe tattoo artist offers a solution: he would do both Conway Twitty AND George Jones, one on each thigh, for only $200 with a free money-back guarantee...if she doesn't like his work, she doesn't have to pay.\n\nShe agrees that's a hell of a deal, so she hops up in the chair, hikes up her skirt and the tattoo artist goes straight to work. He works with dedication and concentration throughout most of the day, first on one thigh and then the other. Hours pass before he finally finishes. He stands up and admires his work and holding a mirror between the girl's knees, he asks her what she thinks of the two tattoos.\n\n\""That looks nothing like Conway Twitty OR George Jones,\"" the girl shouts, \""and I'm not paying you one damn dollar!\""\n\n\""The hell you're not,\"" replied the tattoo artist, \""this is some of the best work I've ever done!\""\n\n\""BULLSHIT!\"" screams the girl, \""I ain't paying!\""\n\nThe artist has an idea. \""Tell you what,\"" he says, \""let's put it to a vote. We'll go outside and ask the first person we see what they think of the tattoos. If they can recognize Conway & George, you're paying! If not, they're free.\""\n\nThe girl agrees, and the two walk outside. There happens to be a homeless man, clearly drunk and sitting on the sidewalk outside the tattoo shop, and the tattoo artist approaches him and explains their predicament and asks the man to judge the tattoos to see if he can recognize who they are.\n\nThe homeless man agrees to help, so the girl walks over to where he is sitting, lifts her skirt and opens her legs in the man's face so he can get a good look at the two tattoos.\n\nThe homeless man, stroking his chin, carefully studies first one tattoo, then the other, then goes back to the first. Several minutes go by and this continues, the homeless man looking back and forth every minute or so until finally the girl says, \""Well, what do you think? Do you recognize these guys or not?!

He tells the doctor the stutter is ruining his life by making it very hard to get a date. The doctor recommends a thorough examination to which the guy agrees. When the guy drops his pants, the doctor sees an enormous penis and determines that is the cause of the stutter. “What can be done?” the guy asks. “The only way to correct the problem is to reduce the size of your penis,” days the doctor.

"So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can’t believe his eyes...

There, in the corner, there’s this one\-foot\-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano. So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?” And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.” So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with *geese*. So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.” And the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve\-inch *pianist*?” So the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve\-inch penis?” And the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?” And the guy’s, like, “World peace.” So the bartender is understandably ashamed. And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender. And the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.” And the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.” But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.” And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?” And the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.” And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?” And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.” So, at around this point, the twelve\-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.” And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey. And the twelve\-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.” And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.” And the twelve\-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!” And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .” And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.” And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat\-up Plymouth Voyager appears! And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!” And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.” And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve\-inch *pianist*?” And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.” And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal. And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey. And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.” And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean *that*.” And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.” And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!” And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms. And suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping. And the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.” And the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!” And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.” And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips. So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie. So the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.” And the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other. And the guy’s, like, “Well done.” And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one\-foot\-tall boyfriend.” And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment. And the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.” And the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer.

A Cowboy sitting in a saloon one Saturday night recognized an elderly man standing at the bar who in his day had the reputation of being the fastest gun in the West. The young cowboy took a place next to the old timer, bought him a drink and told him the story of his great ambition. “Do you think you could give me some tips?” he asked.

Tie the holster a little lower down on your leg.” “Will that make me a better gunfighter?” asked the young man. “Sure will,” replied the old timer. The young man did as he was told, stood up, whipped out his .44 and shot the bow tie off the piano player. “That's terrific!” said the hot shot. “Got any more tips for me?” “Yep,” said the old man. “Cut a notch out of your holster where the hammer hits it. That'll give you a smoother draw.” “Will that make me a better gunfighter?” asked the younger man. “You bet it will,” said the old timer. The young man took out his knife, cut the notch, stood up, drew his gun in a blur, and then shot a cufflink off the piano player. “Wow!” exclaimed the cowboy. “I'm learnin' somethin' here. Got any more tips?” The old man pointed to a large can in a corner of the saloon. “See that axle grease over there? Coat your gun with it.” The young man went over to the can and smeared some of the grease on the barrel of his gun. “No,” said the old timer, “I mean, smear it all over the gun, handle and all.” “Will that make me a better gunfighter?” asked the young man. “No,” said the old timer, “but when Wyatt Earp gets done playing the piano, he's gonna shove that gun up your ass and it won't hurt as much.”",human,3z26oi,113,1451684195,0,1697,1697,331,4.126888217522659,25
"My favourite disappointing joke

A man walks into a bar and the bar keeper says \""Can I get you a drink?\"" \nThe man looks at the barkeep and says \""If I can show you the most amazing thing you've ever seen, will you give me free drinks for the rest of the night?\"" \nThe barkeep thinks about it for a moment and says \""Sounds interesting but I warn you that I'm not easily impressed. Lets see it then\"". \nThe man reaches into his bag an produces a tiny, perfect piano and a stool. \nThe barkeep admires the craftsmanship and says \""Cool toy but I'm not into doll houses\"". \nThe man raises a finger of acknowledgement and reaches back into his bag before producing a dwarf hamster dressed in a tiny tuxedo and places it gently onto the stool. \n\""Cute,\"" says the barkeep \""but I've seen better\"". \nThe man feeds a sunflower seed to the hamster and after stuffing it into his cheek the hamster turns to the piano and starts to play some of the most beautiful music the barkeep has ever heard. \n\""Wow\"" says the wide eyed barkeep \""That's pretty good, but I've seen better.\"" \nThe man lets out an exasperated sigh and reaches deeper into his bag before producing a big green frog and sitting it on the bar next to the hamster and his piano. The barkeep raises an eyebrow as the man bends down and appears to whisper something to the hamster before handing over two seeds. The hamster gleefully stuffs the seeds into its mouth before striking up a different tune on the piano and as if by magic the frog starts singing the most sonorous and powerful operatic performance in time with the piano. \nBy this point a crowd of stunned onlookers has gathered around the bar, the barkeep can't believe the spectacle taking place in front of his eyes and as soon as the performance finishes he turns to the man and says \""That's incredible, your drinks are on the house\"". \nThe man orders a beer and starts to carefully put the show back in his bag. The barkeep returns with his order and says \""Look, I'd be a fool if I didn't ask if you could be tempted into selling your little show, how much do you want for it? \nThe man sips his beer and replies politely \""Sorry, the creatures are my pets and I won't sell them\"" before moving to a corner table for the rest of the evening where he quietly enjoys his free beers by himself. \nThe night eventually draws to a close and the barkeep rings the bell for last orders. The man returns to the bar to order a final drink, the memory of that show has been twirling around the barkeeps mind all night and as he returns with the mans order he decides to make one last offer. \n\""I know you said they weren't for sale but I've got $2000 worth of tips upstairs that I was saving, it's obvious you've got no money otherwise you'd not be making deals in bars like this so how about it, can we make a deal?\"" He says to the man. \nThe man takes a big sip of his beer and looks into space as if deep in thought. After a moment he sighs deeply and says \""Well, I'm trying to get to the big city where I can make some real money but things are getting pretty tight on the road and the show's not worth anything if I never make to the big city at all so I guess we can talk\"". \nThe man reaches into his bag and puts the ensemble back on the bar where he sits and studies them while mumbling quietly to himself about years, numbers, training and occasionally counting on his fingers. He eventually stops, takes a deep breath and begins to explain. \n\""Well the piano took me 4yrs to build and several hundred in materials so that's off the table straight away, the hamster took 5yrs to train and has been a well mannered, loyal friend on the road and I don't think I could part with him but the frog has only been with me for a year and has been foul mouthed and nothing but trouble so I potentially be tempted to offload him for just a little bit more. I'm not a fool and I know what these creatures are worth.\"" \nThe barkeep ponders this for a moment before disappearing upstairs and returning with the jar of tips, he places it on the bar and opens the cash register, he counts out another $500 and pushes the money towards the man. \""$2500 should take you anywhere in the country first class, it's yours for the frog.\"" \nThe man looks pained for a moment and stares at the frog before looking at the cash, he looks back and forth a few times trying to make his decision before eventually saying \""Deal\"" and tucking the money into his bag. \n\""Great!\"" says the barkeep \""A pleasure doing business with you\"". \nThe man takes one long last look at the frog before walking towards the exit. As he proceeds an elderly patron who had been watching them all evening gets up and follows him out the door. \n\""Excuse me\"" the patron says \""Could you hold on a minute?\"" \n\""Sure, what's up?\"" say the man. \n\""I just wanted a final look at the stupidest man on earth as he parts with his fortune!\"" sneers the elderly man \""You could have made millions with that little show of yours!\"" \n\""Yeah I do kinda feel like a dick, I should've-\"" The man starts to reply \n\""You should feel like a dick!\"" The old patron interrupts \""You should have thought about the big picture, you kids these days never thi-\"" \nThe man reaches up and gently presses a finger to the old patrons lips silencing him. \n\""I should have told him that the hamster is a ventriloquist.\""",ai,ai_385,0,0,1,5392,5392,1003,4.375872382851446,33

A baby was born recently that had a congenital condition that caused problems with the development of the delicate tissues on his face. The poor child was born without eyelids. Resourceful doctors and surgeons came up with a plan to circumcise the baby boy and use his foreskin to construct new eyelids, which a talented local plastic surgeon then attached to the existing tissue around his eyes. They can't say for sure how functional the new eyelids will be later in life, but for now the surgery appears to be a huge success, and constant lubrication of his eyes is no longer necessary.

""Nonsense,"" said the pastor, ""I'll look the other way!"" So, the bartender showed the clergyman the door at the top of the stairs, and he proceeded to the toilet. After a few minutes, he came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and dancing again! He went to the bartender and said, ""Sir, I don't understand. When I came in here, the place was hopping with music and dancing. Then the room became absolutely quiet. I went to the toilet, and now the place is hopping again."" ""Well, now you're one of us!"" said the bartender. ""Would you like a drink too?"" ""But, I still don't understand,"" said the puzzled pastor.

"story about a couple who had been happily married for years with one issue

This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years. The only friction in their marriage was the husband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke. The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor. She was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, ""Honey, you were right. All these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you. ""What do you mean?"" asked his wife. ""Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and these two fingers, I think I got them all back in.",human,7ovd79,136,1515378335,0,1978,1978,372,4.317204301075269,18
"The Blue Drink

Ryan was new in the city and had heard about an interesting club on a skyscraper rooftop. Deciding to check it out, Ryan rode the elevator up to the roof. \*Ding\* The elevator doors opened and he was blown away by what he saw. The atmosphere, the music, the people, it was perfect. As he scanned the scene, his heart skipped a beat as he saw a man in a suit on the far end of the roof standing on the edge. Before Ryan could say a word, the gentleman jumped. No one saw, or at least no one reacted to it, save for himself. Completely shocked, he couldn't move. \*Ding\* The man in the suit stepped off the elevator, marched straight to the bar and drunkenly shouted ""Barkeep! Another!"" slamming his hand on the counter. The barkeeper mixed his concoction and poured a glowing blue drink into a glass, passing it to the man in the suit, who downed it instantly. Staggering, he wandered over to the edge of the roof again and jumped. Dumbfounded, Ryan looked on while the club continued to blast its music and the patrons danced. This time, he waited, and sure enough... \*Ding\* The same man walked straight for the bar, slamming his palm on the counter, finger in the air. ""Barkeep! A-another!"" he sputtered out. Interrupting the gentleman before he could absorb his drink, Ryan exclaimed ""HOW? I just--- but you--- you jumped! I saw you!"" With a knowing grin, the man in the suit leaned in close. ""It's this drink! Right after you drink it, you can't die!"" Astonished, Ryan announced to the barkeeper, ""Barkeeper! I'll have what he's having!"" With a shrug, the barkeeper mixed the glowing blue drink once more, sliding it to Ryan. Copying what he'd seen, Ryan downed it in one go and walked over to the edge.

"Aboriginal Rituals

A couple years back, I stumbled on a surprising reference to the astonishing longevity of Aboriginal shamans living in the Australian outback. Reliable birth records aren't available before the early 20th century, but government officials have noted an astounding number of nonagenarians and centenarians. And anthropologists report--but, of course, discount--stories of village elders living for 150 years, 200 years, or more.\n\nThere are weirder stories, incredible enough to be consigned to footnotes in academic texts: that the shaman of Jimbilum arrived in that community in 1872, already impossibly old, and was dispensing advice, justice, and herbal remedies well until the late 1990s. His cause of death is assumed to be exposure: he left the village one night and was never seen again. Implausibly, residents of Ngunulum claim that their shaman--who, again, departed without a word, some time in early 1960s--claimed to have been personally acquainted with William Dampier, a man who last set foot in Australia in 1688.\n\nI try to be careful with extreme claims, so I'm not going to say that every Aboriginal shaman is immortal. I will, though, go so far as to say that there's not a single verifiable case of one of them dying.\n\nIt gets stranger.\n\nLike many traditional faith healers, shamans follow a number of special rules and taboos. You have the usual prayers, incantations, and prohibitions, and one especially odd dietary fixation: shamans insist on drinking a broth made by boiling water and adding chunks of koala meat.\n\nThis is not a minor rule. The departure of the shaman of Jimbilum, for example, coincided with the Australian Department of Environment's launching of a poaching investigation. Ngunulum's spiritual leader left after a long drought led to the death of the region's last remaining koalas.\n\nThere is no record of an Aboriginal shaman dying; there is no record of an Aboriiginal shaman going a day without drinking water that's been steeped in koala flesh and boiled.\n\nI had to investigate.\n\nYou're familiar with the Dark Web, right? (Don't kid me--of course you are.) I opened an account on one of the lesser-known sites, one that ignored narcotics and credit cards, in favor of more exotic goods. For .275 bitcoin (shipping included), I had a sample of freshly-harvested koala meat en route.\n\nAfter two weeks, I was pretty sure I'd been had. And pretty sure I deserved it, too. How much time and money should a grown adult spend investigating third-hand reports--and violating endangered species laws on several continents, to boot?\nBut then, on Monday, a package arrived. Lumpy, misshappen, sealed with three different kinds of tape, it felt strangely heavy and cool to the touch.\n\nI opened it.\n\nThe roiling steam looked a lot less dramatic when I realized that, obviously, when you ship meat intercontinentally, you pack it with dry ice.\n\nThe koala looks smaller on your kitchen counter than it looks in pictures. I've seen lots of pictures of koalas, and always thought they looked cute, but never tasty. The impression doesn't improve in person.\n\nBut it was too late to turn back. I'd already set some water to boil. I stashed most of the koala in the freezer, and sliced off a toe.\n\nIn 1927, anthropologist Ursula McConnel recorded a list of rituals of the Wik Mungkan. Among them, the ceremonial boiling of a water infused with koala bits. Exactly 1.2 liters, exactly 3 hours. I followed her recipe to the letter.\n\nAnd it was DISGUSTING. The foulest, nastiest thing I'd ever tasted. It coats your tongue and lacerates your nostrils and the taste stays with you for hours and the memory is with me still. If this was the route to immortality, maybe dying was a better option.\n\nBut I wasn't finished with my research. I pored over my books and papers, looking for more information on the ritual, and found that it was, in fact, permissible to fiddle with the recipe. Shamans in different regions had different spins on the concoction: as long as you boiled the water long enough, and used genuine koala, the other ingredients didn't matter.\n\nAfter some experimentation, I've found exactly the right mix of flavorings to make it about as tasty as any other beverage.\n\nI guess you could say this really improved my koala tea of life.",ai,ai_5400,0,0,1,4328,4328,697,5.209469153515064,46
"So there was this guy who wanted to be a train conductor.

Now this is more of a story than a joke, but bear with me... So back in the 30's or sometime there was this guy who desperately wanted to be a train conductor. It all started in his early childhood. Ya see, he was orphaned from a very young age, but he still had very vivid memories of his parents. Now, his parents were horrible people, they abused him, and most of all scoffed at his aspirations of becoming a train conductor. He had run away and took up residence in the local orphanage. There all he dreamed of was being a REAL train conductor. He told all the staff, and they all supported his dreams. Several years pass and one day the owner of the orphanage came up to him and says: ""I am friends with the conductor at the train station, he's an old man like me and he's going to be retiring soon. He wanted to finish out this year, but he has offered you the position of ticket collector, so you can see how he runs the show. Once he retires you would be the new train conductor."" Now at this point our guy is elated. His dreams are coming true! He agrees to take the ticket collector position and will start the following morning. He wakes up at the crack of dawn and sets off for the train station. Everything was going well, he collects tickets flawlessly for about 3 or 4 months. During the middle of his shift, he notices a woman that has a striking resemblance to his mother. His mother was not in the same ballpark as anyone who is considered attractive, and he assumes it's her immediately. His heart starts racing, and he walks straight up to her. He takes his ticket puncher and begins to beat her with it. Now I'm not going to go into the gory details about how he's using this ticket puncher, but just know it is gruesome. There's blood everywhere, small circular patches of skin all over the floor and the seats. The passengers are mortified. He kills this woman, and the police arrest him, he pleads guilty, is sentenced to death, and is taken to prison. He is scheduled to be executed in a week, and like any man would, is dreading it. He thinks about how he would have done things differently, and maybe controlled his emotions if he was put in this scenario again. The night before his execution is a really stormy night, and his spirits are as low as ever. The jail guard senses that he's down and thinks he can cheer him up a bit with his last meal. A slight smile appears across his face, and he asks for his favorite, chicken fried steak, with a side of fried okra. He eats everything on the plate and asks for more. The method of execution during this time was the electric chair, and the operators were getting it set up for its next victim. The execution is going quite normally, or as normally as any execution can go, and our guy sits down in his chair. They put the hat on his head. Strap him down. Ask for any last words. Then begin to electrocute him. This execution is more spectacular than any other execution these men have ever seen before. There's smoke, violent thrashing, and worst of all screaming. After a minute or so they cut the power. He's sitting in the chair very motionless. They begin to unstrap him and much to their surprise he sits up! Now his punishment was to be electrocuted by the electric chair, and he was in fact electrocuted in the electric chair. They can't punish the poor man again, so they release him hoping he's learned his lesson. He picks up his job collecting tickets again and is told if he does anything wrong again, he's out of there. Once again several months pass, and as he is collecting tickets, he runs into a man who is reminiscent of his father. His mother was bad, but to him his father was worse. He doesn't even have the composure to walk over to him. He breaks out into a sprint down 3 train cars. He tackles the man and once again murders him (much more brutally than the last one). The same thing happens that happened to him last time. He is sent to court. Sentenced to death by the electric chair, and sent to prison. He asks for a last meal, which he is denied, and is sitting in the electric chair the next day. This time the operators aren't fucking around. They douse this guy in water. Turn up the power to levels that are high enough to kill an elephant. They turn it on, and just as last time there is a shitload of thrashing, screaming smoke, and the smell of burning hair and flesh. They leave that sucker on for muccchhh too long for anyone to possibly survive it. They cut the power, and check to see if the man still lives. Much to their dismay he, although burned, hairless, and in a world of hurt, sits up. The lead operator loses his mind and gets in his face. ""HOW! How are you still alive!? I understand that the first time it may have been a freak accident, but this time we were going to make SURE you were dead.""

"In 1964, a couple of former St. Louis Cardinals baseball stars were on vacation in Wales....

Red Schoendienst and Stan Musial decided to head to the UK on vacation with their wives after the 1964 Major League Baseball season. The two had retired as players the year before and had just finished their first full season as members of the staff - Musial as vice president, Schoendienst as a coach - and they decided to take a couple of weeks and go all around the UK. They landed in London, went up and through Scotland, and were spending a night in Wales. As they had gone, a few people happily recognized Red, mainly American tourists, but Stan was something else. Everywhere the 4 of them went, the people just seemed to automatically get a great affection for him. Whether it was Americans on vacation as well, or well-to-do Londoners or blue-collar workers in the Black Country or farmers in Scotland, he somehow just was able to create an automatic rapport with everyone. And so it was, this night in Wales. The two couples were sitting at a table in a night club, enjoying a couple drinks and the music being performed there. After a little while, this 20-something crooner came out and the four of them were amazed at this young man's awesome voice. After he was done, Red and Stan wanted to offer some kind words to him, so Stan talked to the manager and after a moment or two, the manager brought them backstage to meet the singer, a young man named Tom Jones. Red and Stan introduced themselves to the Welshman, who had heard of the two future Hall of Famers, but was surprised that a pair of American sports stars had wanted to meet him, just some young guy singing in a club. Nonsense, they told him. They had seen that he had a special talent, and that, with hard work and a little luck, he could be a huge star. The young man thanked them and they talked for about another 15 minutes before Stan and Red asked Tom to join them and their wives for a drink. He thought for a moment and then agreed. It was here that Tom noticed that all the staff were so nice to Stan. The servers, who were occasionally a little preoccupied, were acting like he was a favorite uncle. The bartender was already on a first-name basis with him. Even the manager, who Tom had known for over a year and just started to warm up to him, was openly friendly with the American baseball star. Tom was stunned by this change of attitude in everyone and pulled Red aside for a moment to ask him about it: ""Red, you and Stan never were here before, right?"" ""Right."" ""Then how come everyone seems to be on such good terms with Stan?"" ""It's just something with him. That happens everywhere we go. It's been like that for years. There's just something about his personality. He said his father was like that as well."" ""Wow, Red. That must be something amazing. It just seems so strange to me to be able to make people that happy that fast."" Red Schoendienst put his arm around the young singer and chuckled and told him: ""Ah, you see, Tom Jones, it's not un-Musial to be loved by anyone.""",human,e0tj2b,5,1574568437,0,3068,3068,566,4.420494699646643,32
