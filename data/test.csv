"I was in a small city in Israel...

and I met this gorgeous woman. Truly beautiful. We had a crazy night of drinking, and passion, and maybe even love, but she was gone in the morning, and I had to go back home. I couldn't even remember her name, only the translation she'd given me into English. \""A length of time.\"" It was a dumb thing to remember. It also wasn't much to go off of, especially with my drunken memories distorting everything else. \n\nWell, I went back recently to the same city and thought \""I should look for her.\"" It was a small city, a town, really, and so I thought that, surely, someone would know this woman, or even me, but I still didn't have her name, so I did what I could.\n\nEverywhere I went, I kept asking about a beautiful woman whose name meant \""a length of time\"" in English. I tried to remind them of myself, and of the night I'd been there. But, no matter what I said, no one seemed to know what I meant. I didn't blame them. Half of them didn't speak English, and to the half that did I sounded crazy, but I had to keep looking. I just knew that she was still there. So I asked and asked and asked until I'd almost given up. That's when a young man approached me.\n\n\""You look for Era, sir?\"" His accent was thick, his English broken, but I'd heard him loud and clear.\n\n\""Yes!\"" The name had struck a chord in me. Era. Of course. How could I have forgotten such a simple name? \""How did you know? Can you take me to her?\""\n\n\""Yes, sir. Know you from last time. Was child then, but see you with Era, sir. I take you now.\""\n\nSo, the youth and I took off through the streets. My heart raced. My thoughts pounded. Before long, we came to a square and I saw her. She was older, but so was I. I knew it was her. That face. That body. It had to be. \""Era!\"" I called out. \""Era! It's me!\"" \n\nBut the youth grabbed my hand to stop me. \""Not her, sir. That Era twin.\"" \n\n\""What? She never told me.\"" Perhaps she had told me, perhaps I'd even met this twin, but I couldn't remember in the haze of my ancient memories. \""What's her name? How do you tell them apart?\""\n\nThe youth smiled at me. \""That's Ya, sir. Era fat.\""",ai,ai_3837,0,0,1

A week after arriving back home in the States, he wakes one morning to find his penis covered with bright green and purple spots. Horrified, he immediately goes to see a doctor.

Go ahead, if you want, but surgery is your only option.” The next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he’ll know more about the disease. The Chinese doctor examines his penis and proclaims, ""Ahh... yes, Mongolian VD. Very rare disease."" The guy says to the doctor, ""Yeah, yeah, I already know that, but what can we do? My American doctor wants to cut off my penis!"" The Chinese doctor shakes his head and laughs, ""Stupid Amelican docttah, always want operate, make more money that way. No need amputate!""

"Mordred's hidden power

King Arthur has lately been very fond of Morgause. News has it that she bore him a son which was named Mordred, not thinking about the repercussions it might bring to his kingdom. On the other hand, the G brothers (Morgause's sons to her husband Lot) weren't very fond of their mother's incest-begotten son. \n\nYeaes have passed, the brothers wanted to get rid of Mordred. However, it was very unhonorable for a knight to kill a boy who can't defend himself. The brothers then waited for Mordred to become a knight himself. When he became a full-fledged knight in service of King Arthur, the brothers came up with a plan. \n\nOne of them is to challenge Mordred to a duel, and would dismiss his death as an accident while sparring. The brothers agreed that this is a foolproof plan, as Mordred seemed weaker than any of them, but boy were they in for a surprise. \n\nIt was Gaheris who challenged him. After exchanging a couple of blows, it seemed like Mordred changed his weapon and armor in the blink of an eye, countering his arsenal. With this new weapon and armor, Gaheris knew that he can't possibly defeat Mordred now. \n\nAggravayne challenged him next, and the same thing happened during their battle. Mordred's armor and weapon changed in the middle of the battle, and his greatsword became useless. As he fell on his knees, he came up with a better plan. He warned his brothers about this power, and that they should challenge him 2 on 1.\n\nNo longer wanting to further taint their family's honor, Gawain and Gareth challenged Mordred 2 on 1 to get rid of him for good. They expected him turn down this challenge, but he obliged. They thought that they have the upper hand as there are two of them, but they underestimated Mordred's power. In less than a second, his armor hardened that not even a diamond can scratch it. Their swords broke as they clashed with Mordred's. Hopeless, the 2 of them surrendered and asked Mordred about his ability. \n\nMordred, with the most impish grin he can muster, simply told them:\n\n\""Does it ever drive you crazy just how fast the knight changes?\""",ai,ai_5485,0,0,1

"I recall the time years ago when my friend and I went on our secret spy mission. Like any other highly trained operatives, we were tasked with infiltrating the local mattress store.

It had been reported several times for housing a suspicious number of fans. (a Code 182). Per our orders, my partner and I snuck into the establishment, taking up hiding under the blankets of some nearby display beds. Sure enough, the place was crawling with fans: ceiling fans, upright fans, and worst of all, those folding paper fans. Frankly, it was terrifying, but our nerves were steeled from years of spy training. Remaining calm we stayed hidden under the blankets gathering intel. But suddenly, from out of nowhere, I could hear my partner shout in horror and run past my hiding spot towards the store’s exit. I feared the worst. Was he okay? Had a fan discovered his location? Frightened and confused by his hasty escape, I contacted him through my earpiece. “What’s wrong?! Why didn’t you stay in your bed?!” Panting in fear, he responded. “My cover’s been blown!”",human,cty0i9,16,1566483190,0

"All his life, Harry wanted to be a cable-car operator...

... so one day he enrolled in cable-car operator school in New York. He was a fair student, but not great, and after several years of study, he graduated with a C average and was assigned as part of a job-placement program to a route in Manhattan. He loved his new job and everything was great for a while until one day he wasn't paying very close attention and lost control of his cable-car. It hopped its track and careened off of a pier into the Hudson River. All of his passengers were killed but Harry managed to swim back to shore. He was terrified of what would happen so he fled the scene (and, eventually, the city) before police and rescue crews could arrive.\n\nHe settled in Houston under an assumed name and took a job in a grocery store, trying to keep as low a profile as possible. He lived a quiet life, and every day he would watch the Houston cable-cars going up and down the street and he longed for what he had lost. One day, he decided that he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school again, this time in Houston and under his new name. He did a little better this time, having been through the classwork before, and graduated with a B average and was assigned to a nice route in La Porte. His passengers loved him and he loved his job. But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable car. It hopped its track and ended up in Trinity Bay. All of his passengers were killed, but Harry managed to swim back to shore. Fearing that authorities would put this accident together with the one in New York, he again fled the scene.\n\nThis time he ended up in San Francisco with yet another assumed name. He figured that, if he couldn't operate his beloved cable cars (for fear of getting caught), he could at least see them everywhere he went, as San Francisco is the cable-car capital of the world. This satisfied him for a little while, but eventually he couldn't take it anymore and enrolled in cable-car operator school yet again. He excelled in his classwork this time around (having been through the program twice before) and graduated magna cum laude. He was assigned the highly-coveted Market Street route and drove it for quite a while without incident. But one day, he wasn't paying attention and lost control of his cable-car. It hopped its tracks and ended up in the San Francisco Bay. All of his passengers were killed and as Harry swam back to shore, the police were waiting for him.\n\nIn the subsequent investigation and trial, prosecutors put all the pieces together. They figured that he was the same guy who killed all those people in Houston and New York. It was the trial of the century and at the end of it, Harry was sentenced to die in the electric chair for his crimes (the actions having been deemed so egregiously willful and persistent as to constitute premeditation). He was transferred to Alcatraz to await his execution.\nHe was a model prisoner, never causing any trouble, and every day he woke and did exactly 52 jumping jacks and 52 sit-ups and 52 push-ups in his cell to keep himself occupied. The day before his scheduled execution, the warden came to him and asked what he would like for his last meal. Harry thought about it for a minute and said “I would like a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk”. The warden stared blankly at him. “Harry,” he said, “we have access to the best chefs in the world. This is your last meal, and you can have anything you want. Steak, lobster, name it!” Harry shook his head and repeated his request for a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk. His disgusting meal was brought to him and he wolfed it down hungrily. The next day, his head was shaved and last rites were administered, and Harry was led to the electric chair and hooked up. At the appointed time, prison guards threw the switch and counted to ten before turning off the current to the chair. But Harry was fine. Smoldering a bit at the spots where the contacts met his skin, perhaps, but otherwise the picture of health.\n\nFlummoxed, the guards took Harry back to his cell and began the long process of checking and rechecking their equipment for malfunctions, but they couldn’t find anything. A new execution date was set for one month later, and Harry went back to his morning exercise routine of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups to keep his mind and body occupied while he waited.\n\nThe eve of his second execution arrived and the warden visited Harry again to take the order for his last meal. “A rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk,” Harry said. The warden just shook his head and asked him Harry was sure, then arranged to have his meal brought to him. The next day, guards shaved his head again, Harry was administered his last rites again, and he was marched to the electric chair and hooked up again. This time, though, they weren’t taking any chances. At the appropriate time, they threw the switch and left the juice flowing for a full minute. And when they were finished, Harry was just fine.\n\nThe warden was nervous. A little known California law stipulated that the state could only make three attempts to execute a prisoner, and if that failed they had to let him go. Harry was returned to his cell where he resumed his daily morning exercise regimen of 52 jumping jacks, 52 sit-ups, and 52 push-ups. Another month passed, and on the eve of his third execution, Harry was visited by the warden, who just said “let me guess” as he wheeled in a cart with a rotten banana, a rotten apple, and a glass of spoiled milk. Harry thanked him politely and ate his dinner. The next morning, they shaved his head (AGAIN!) and delivered last rites (AGAIN!) and marched him to the execution chamber, where he was hooked up (AGAIN!) to the electric chair. This time, prison officials weren’t taking any chances. The entire Bay Area power grid was diverted to Alcatraz. They threw the switch (cutting electricity to millions of customers) and left the juice running for a full half hour. The execution chamber buzzed with the awesome power being fed into the chair. You could taste the ions in the air. And when they turned off the power….\n\nHarry was just fine. The warden shook his head in disbelief. “Well, Harry,” he said, “we have to let you go. California law stipulates that we can only make three attempts at an execution. But before I do, I really have to know. How did you survive three executions? Was it the jumping jacks, the sit-ups, and the push-ups? Was it the rotten banana, rotten apple, and spoiled milk? What IS your secret?”\n\n\nHarry just shook his head and shrugged, “I guess I’m just not a very good conductor.”",ai,ai_6620,0,0,1

"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.

His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n\nSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n\nAnd on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... \n\nAnd the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n\nAnd on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n\nSuddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.\n\nThe townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.\n\nThe mayor approached the lead monk of the order. \""What happened?\"" he asked, exasperated.\n\nThe old monk shook his head sadly. \""Isn't it obvious?\"" he said. \""Sam sung Note 7.\""\n\n\n\n\n\n- EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up!

"Funeral

As a guitarist, I play many gigs. Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost.\n\nI finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.\n\nI felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.\n\nThe workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.\n\nAnd as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car.

"Everyone needs a little relaxation time once in a while [Long]

So my friend and I decided to unwind and visit this Day Spa that she highly recommended.\n\nI had never heard of it before and asked her what was so great about it. However she refused to tell me why it was so good.\n\nSo we scheduled a visit for the following Sunday and when we arrived I realised why I’d never heard of it before. It was literally named ‘Day Spa’\n\nWhen we arrived we were greeted by this pretty looking receptionist who checked us in and directed us to a dressing room to get changed into the spa provided dressing gowns.\n\nWe left our things in a nearby locker and walked deeper into the spa. At this point my friend has this huge grin on her face and finally decides to tell me why this place is so good.\n\nShe explains that there are 26 different rooms of treatment each labelled A-Z and each specialising in different treatments from foot rubs to full body massages to hot stones.\n\nSo we agreed to split up and meet back up in 2 hours.\n\nThe first room I go into is room A. It’s quiet, and the only thing in the room is a single seat with an A engraved on it as well as a curtain. \n\nSo I sit down and almost instantly this beautiful woman pops out from behind the curtain and starts placing various hot towels on different parts of my body.\n\n15 mins later she takes them away and I get off of the seat, thoroughly relaxed and a lot less tense.\n\nNext I go into room F and, just like in room A there sits a single seat with the letter F engraved on it.\n\nI take a seat and hear a clanking sound beneath me. Before I can wonder what it is, the floor suddenly sinks into a circular hole.\n\nI was quite startled, that is until the hole started filling with warm water and the air was filled with a sweet, thick aroma.\n\n‘Herbal bath’ I realised. ‘Not bad’\n\nAnother 30 minutes pass and I decide I want to try something else, so I go to stand up but at that moment the floor starts to rise again and the water sinks back into the floor. ‘Neat’ I think to myself.\n\nI try a few other rooms and they’re all pretty similar at first glance with the seats being engraved with whatever room number they were in.\n\nThat is until is get to room O, where I see a big line has formed with people waiting excitedly at the door. \n\nI spot my friend at the end of the line and ask her why everyone’s so eager to get into this room.\n\nShe tells me that this is the best room in the entire day spa and that people sometimes book months in advance to reserve the seat.\n\nAfter 30 minutes or so of queueing, it’s my friend’s turn, 5 minutes later she comes out with the most relaxed and calm look on her face. \n\nI ask her what happened but she just winks at me and said I’ll “find out”\n\nI walk into the room and excitedly sit myself on seat O.\n\nSuddenly, a team of masseuses walk out from behind the curtain and begin to massage all over my body. They use hot wax, stones, towels, and every type of lotion and ointment I can recognise, and many I can’t. The music is also stunning, with angelic choirs and lustrous saxophones playing softly in the back ground\n\n5 minutes later I meet my friend outside and we leave the day spa, feeling utterly calm and relaxed.\n\nAbout a week later, some other friends of mine are discussing ways they like to relax. One of them says that music helps her unwind, another says she uses walks through the forest.\n\nThey turn to me and ask what I use to relax.\n\nI reply:\n\nDay Spa, Seat O.",ai,ai_3742,0,0,1

I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me, and they ask me. They say, 'What's 2+2'? And I tell them, look, we know what 2+2 is.

It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that.

"The New York Philharmonic was conducting a rendition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony

If you are not familiar with Beethoven's 9th Symphony it's a tremendous piece of work, but the bass line is atrocious. Not because it is complicated, but because it goes like this:\n\n**\""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\""**\n\n\n\nAnd then approximately an hour an a half later it goes like this:\n\n\n\n**\""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\""**\n\n\nAnd then there's a round of applause and everyone take their bows and and exits stage right. The conductor had a great idea though, and the basses practiced this in the weeks leading up to the concert. The would play their first note \n\n**\""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\""**\n\n\nAnd then they would quietly lay down their basses on provided carpets, and exit the stage - waiting patiently to return an hour and a half later to play their final note:\n\n\n**\""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\""**\n\n\n\n\nThe night of the concert arrives, everyone is dressed to the nines (as is appropriate of course). The basses are shined and everyone is relaxed and ready. The conducter taps on his conducter's stand to get attention, raises his hands and with a gallant downstroke the basses play the ever living shit out of their note\n\n\n**\""bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\""**\n\n\n\nAnd then quietly lay down their instruments on the provided carpets and step behind the curtain. This is where things go awry,\n\n\""Hey guys,\"" says the lead bass \""I have a great idea. There's a bar across the street and we have at least an hour and a half before we play our next note. Let's slip across and have a couple pints!\""\n\n\nEveryone thinks this is a fantastic idea, so the entire section hops along to the bar and downs a couple pints. One of the second basses after a while gets a little conserned and asks the lead bass if it was time to go back. \""No, we got time. See, I tied a string to the last page of the conductors score attached to a transciever. When he gets to that section I'll get a buzz on my phone and we can head back.\""\n\n\nEveryone thinks that this is brilliant so they knock back a few more pints before suddenly the lead bass stands up and announces it's time to go. They bounce back across the street, through the musicians entrance, and up to the curtain to peek through and sure enough, they're right on time. So they slip through, pick up their instruments and look up at the conductor and...he is angry.\n\nSuper angry. \n\n\nReady to bust a blood vessel angry.\n\n\n\nBut you would be too wouldn't you?

Lets see it then\"". \nThe man reaches into his bag an produces a tiny, perfect piano and a stool. \nThe barkeep admires the craftsmanship and says \""Cool toy but I'm not into doll houses\"". \nThe man raises a finger of acknowledgement and reaches back into his bag before producing a dwarf hamster dressed in a tiny tuxedo and places it gently onto the stool. \n\""Cute,\"" says the barkeep \""but I've seen better\"". \nThe man feeds a sunflower seed to the hamster and after stuffing it into his cheek the hamster turns to the piano and starts to play some of the most beautiful music the barkeep has ever heard. \n\""Wow\"" says the wide eyed barkeep \""That's pretty good, but I've seen better.\"" \nThe man lets out an exasperated sigh and reaches deeper into his bag before producing a big green frog and sitting it on the bar next to the hamster and his piano. The barkeep raises an eyebrow as the man bends down and appears to whisper something to the hamster before handing over two seeds. The hamster gleefully stuffs the seeds into its mouth before striking up a different tune on the piano and as if by magic the frog starts singing the most sonorous and powerful operatic performance in time with the piano. \nBy this point a crowd of stunned onlookers has gathered around the bar, the barkeep can't believe the spectacle taking place in front of his eyes and as soon as the performance finishes he turns to the man and says \""That's incredible, your drinks are on the house\"". \nThe man orders a beer and starts to carefully put the show back in his bag. The barkeep returns with his order and says \""Look, I'd be a fool if I didn't ask if you could be tempted into selling your little show, how much do you want for it? \nThe man sips his beer and replies politely \""Sorry, the creatures are my pets and I won't sell them\"" before moving to a corner table for the rest of the evening where he quietly enjoys his free beers by himself. \nThe night eventually draws to a close and the barkeep rings the bell for last orders. The man returns to the bar to order a final drink, the memory of that show has been twirling around the barkeeps mind all night and as he returns with the mans order he decides to make one last offer. \n\""I know you said they weren't for sale but I've got $2000 worth of tips upstairs that I was saving, it's obvious you've got no money otherwise you'd not be making deals in bars like this so how about it, can we make a deal?\"" He says to the man. \nThe man takes a big sip of his beer and looks into space as if deep in thought. After a moment he sighs deeply and says \""Well, I'm trying to get to the big city where I can make some real money but things are getting pretty tight on the road and the show's not worth anything if I never make to the big city at all so I guess we can talk\"". \nThe man reaches into his bag and puts the ensemble back on the bar where he sits and studies them while mumbling quietly to himself about years, numbers, training and occasionally counting on his fingers. He eventually stops, takes a deep breath and begins to explain. \n\""Well the piano took me 4yrs to build and several hundred in materials so that's off the table straight away, the hamster took 5yrs to train and has been a well mannered, loyal friend on the road and I don't think I could part with him but the frog has only been with me for a year and has been foul mouthed and nothing but trouble so I potentially be tempted to offload him for just a little bit more. I'm not a fool and I know what these creatures are worth.\"" \nThe barkeep ponders this for a moment before disappearing upstairs and returning with the jar of tips, he places it on the bar and opens the cash register, he counts out another $500 and pushes the money towards the man. \""$2500 should take you anywhere in the country first class, it's yours for the frog.\"" \nThe man looks pained for a moment and stares at the frog before looking at the cash, he looks back and forth a few times trying to make his decision before eventually saying \""Deal\"" and tucking the money into his bag. \n\""Great!\"" says the barkeep \""A pleasure doing business with you\"". \nThe man takes one long last look at the frog before walking towards the exit. As he proceeds an elderly patron who had been watching them all evening gets up and follows him out the door. \n\""Excuse me\"" the patron says \""Could you hold on a minute?\"" \n\""Sure, what's up?\"" say the man. \n\""I just wanted a final look at the stupidest man on earth as he parts with his fortune!\"" sneers the elderly man \""You could have made millions with that little show of yours!\"" \n\""Yeah I do kinda feel like a dick, I should've-\"" The man starts to reply \n\""You should feel like a dick!\"" The old patron interrupts \""You should have thought about the big picture, you kids these days never thi-\"" \nThe man reaches up and gently presses a finger to the old patrons lips silencing him. \n\""I should have told him that the hamster is a ventriloquist.\""",ai,ai_385,0,0,1

A man working at the Federal Reserve was hired to manufacture pennies.

The liquid metal is then poured into a mold that makes a smaller block. That smaller block is then taken off the conveyer belt by this control arm and placed on another conveyer belt.

Those cubes are individually melted down again and poured into a mold with 25 slots that shape the tails side of the penny. Each penny is then stamped on the other side with the heads side, which completes the penny. All of the pennies are cooled, rolled, and stored for shipping.

"When my grandfather was a young boy living outside a small town in rural Kentucky

they didn't have much as way of entertainment except for fishing and hunting with his big shaggy dog, Bear. When he wasn't helping his parents out with chores, he spent most of his summers out in the forests camping with Bear, hunting squirrels and rabbits, or just fishing along the river. He'd wandered a bit further away one day than he normally did, and came across an old monastary with a congregation of friars. \n\nNow, this region of Kentucky wasn't very well off, so what a lot of the small town farmers did was take their goods in to the larger city to sell at farmers markets and to stores. The friars were no exception to this because while they didn't need much money, they did need some to buy food and clothes. When my grandfather came across that old monastary, he'd seen acre after acre of wide open meadows just full of wildflowers of every sort you could imagine. Big yellow flowers, little red and blue speckled flowers, daisies, queen's lace. The fields were alive with bees buzzing and humming birds humming, truly, it was a beautiful, inspiring sight. And out there, scattered throughout the meadows, the friars, each with a big woven basket filled to the brim with boquets they crafted by hand. These were what they would send in to town to be sold.\n\nMy great grandfather, that is, my grandpa's dad, worked for a man that lived in the city most of the local farmers would travel to to sell their produce. This man was a baron of sorts; he owned several businesses in town and he was always on the look out for a new business or property to invest in to grow his wealth. His name was Hugh, and he wasnt known for his huge, friendly demeanor. What he was known for was his ruthless and cunning sense of busines. Hugh never let anything get in his way when it came to growing his business. \n\nA year after my grandpa and Bear met the friars, a reporter came to town to photograph the festival they had every summer in town. This festival was the town's yearly highlight, at least as big a deal as Thanksgiving and nearly as big a deal as Easter and Christmas (which in those days made it a Very Big Deal indeed)! Every year for the festival the friars would supply the most stunning flower arrangements for the town's main street, through which the town would have a small parade with the mayor tossing candies for all the children, and men and women in costumes dancing along to music played by the school's small band. Folk from all around the town would journey in for the day, set up food stalls to sell pies and hot cakes, roast rabbit on toast and spicy squirrel stew. This year the festival was held in even higher anticipation because of the participation of the local fire department. They'd offered to lead the parade with a big red firetruck, and the firemen all dressed up in celebration. \n\nThe fire department's presence was as much for the celebration as it was for safety. The previous year an unfortunate accident had caused a large fire to catch and spread to the forest around the town. Several blocks of the town had been evacuated before the fire was finally contained and put out, but not before some acres of the forest had burned down. But that event had gotten my grandpa's small town on the radar of the big city, and the local paper had decided to feature them in an article this particular summer! \n\nThe festival was a tremendous success! The food was fantastic, the parade was picturesque! The friars flower displays were the highlight of the night, and the photographer made sure to do them as much justice as he could. Truly, they were the talk of the festival, to the point that some weeks later at the next farmers market in the city, the friars sold out of their boquets in the first hour of the morning! Word had spread, pardon the pun, like a fire, and everyone wanted to buy the friars flowers!\n\nEven old Hugh had seen and heard word of the sudden popularity of these boquets and went down to the market to see for himself. He stood, mouth agape, as a crowed massed around the floral displays, pushing to be the next to buy before the flowers were all gone. Much to the dismay of the friars, their newfound popularity lead to incredible new demand. And though they did try to prepare more boquets for the market, they were realy selling more than they'd ever intended. For while the did it for a little money to afford necessiries, for the friars, spreading beauty and peace with their flowers was more than enough in return.\n\nWhen Hugh saw the potential in the popularity of the flowers the friars grew, his mind immediately started working on a way to turn it to his benefit. He waited for the crowds to finally die down and went to speak to the holy men. \n\n\""I'd like to make you an offer,\"" Hugh said. \""Your beautiful flowers are the talk of the town. I'd like to help you out by handling all the sales of the flowers for you, for a small cut of the profit! That way, you can focus on growing and creating your wonderful boquets, without worrying about the hassle and bother of coming into the market each week and dealing with the crowds!\""\n\nThe friars thanked Hugh for his offer, but they explained to him that for them, the boquets were not just a business endeavor, it was their service to the community to spread peace and joy with God's flowers and blessings. And with that, the friars packed up and started the journey back to their monastary.\n\nWell, Hugh was not satisfied at all with that answer, and he came up with a plan. Over the next few weeks he ordered crate after craft of exotic flowers from all around the world. Beautiful flowers from Morocco to France, stunning petals from China to India. Anything colorful and amazing that he could learn about. He set up a large shop just down the road from the Farmer's market where the Friars had their stall, and he called it The Festival Flourist and Fantastic Flowers. At first, the town was abuzz with these new and wonderful flowers, but after a few weeks, as the novelty wore off, the sales declined and soon Hugh's shop was empty. \n\nFor some reason he couldn't figure out, though, the friars were doing as well as ever! Week in and out, lines down the street would stand patiently waiting for the friars flowers. And cunning as he was, Hugh would not rest until he'd made his new business a success. \n\nA year or so later, my grandpa was on another fishing adventure with Bear, just following allong with stream, sometimes wading through the shallower parts of the water, othertimes dropping in a line and resting in the shade of a tree, when he saw thick, black smoke rising above the forest. Curious as any young boy would be, he set off at a run through the trees, heading towards the smoke. \n\nWhen he reached a large open meadow, a devastating sight lay before him: dozens of friars with brooms and small buckets were frantically working through the flower meadows tyring their best to fight thick, hot flames that were scorching along the ground! Some how, all the flower meadows had caught fire, and try as they might, nothing the friars could do was stopping the flames. \n\nThe fire department was evnetually contacted and they made it out to the monastary before too much of the forest had burned down, but sadly all of the flowers in the meadows had been left a charred, ruined mess. For the first time in years, the friars had no flowers to for the town's festival. Full of dismay, they sent word to the mayor that there was nothing they could do to salvage the flower displays for that year's parade, and whispers grew with worry that the festival that year might not live up to the town's hopes. \n\nIt was then that, just by hapenstance, Hugh visited town to meet with the mayor about opening a new business there in town. When he heard about the problems with the fire and the flowers, of course he'd be delighted to supply the town with all the flowers they could need, for a small fee. In the end, I'm afraid that there's no truly happy ending here: the Mayor accepted Hugh's flowers and his flower shop's popularity grew from then on. \n\nBut the moral of the story is this, my friends: \n\nHugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.",ai,ai_1233,0,0,1

he Pope met with his Cardinals to discuss a proposal from Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of Israel.

The Pope thought this was a good idea but he had never held a golf club in his hands. ""Don't we have a Cardinal to represent me?"" he asked. ""None who plays very well,"" a Cardinal replied.

"Mbeki and his elephant

Mbeki was a boy who live in a small village on the edge of the great Serengeti plain of Africa. Mbeki would spend days watching the animals on the plain, learning and studying their behaviors.\n\nTwice a year during the great animal migration from their summer to their winter feeding grounds and back, the villagers would gather their meagre belongings and hide in caves in the hills above their village. When they returned, they would find that their village had been ravaged by marauding elephants that would strip the straw and logs from their mud huts for food.\n\nAfter one devastating year when the village was almost completely destroyed, Mbeki vowed to learn as much as he could about elephants to help his village. \n\nOne day as he sat hidden in the tall grass he saw an old bull elephant with a broken tusk that appeared to be in distress. As Mbeki crawlled closer to observe, he noticed that the elephant was holding one foot off the ground. Mbeki crawed closer still and saw there was blood on the elephant's foot. \n\nMbeki stood and approached the elephant nervously and saw a large thorn stuck beneath the elephant's foot. Screwing up his courage Mbeki held the elephant's foot in one hand and pulled at the thorn with all his might with his other hand. The thorn came loose at last, Mbeki gave a shout of triumph and the elephant gave a loud trumpet. \n\nSuddenly the elephant wrapped his trunk around Mbeki and lifted him high off the ground and Mbeki and the elephant looked at each other. Mbeki saw joy and thankfulness in the elephant's wise old eyes. After a long while the elephant gently placed Mbeki on the ground and stamped his front foot on the ground three times and slowly turned and walked away. \n\nAfter that day Mbeki vowed to double his efforts to learn all he could about the elephants. Soon he became famous for his knowledge throughout the land and was invited by neighbouring villages and cities and countries to talk about his experiences. \n\nMany years later, Mbeki now an old man after a long career travelling the world as the world's foremost expert on elephants finds himself back in the village he had lived as a child. But oh how it had grown, no longer a small dusty village of mud tracks and mud huts it was a modern city filled with all the trappings of modernity and a million people. It even had it's own zoo. Mbeki decides to visit. Mbeki walked around the animal enclosures smiling, remembering his life as a boy when suddenlh behind him he heard an elephant blow his trumpet. \n\nMbeki turn and there, in front of him, an elephant with a broken task with it's trunk raised. They looked at each other, the elephant stamped it's feet on the ground three times. Mbeki could not believe it, his heart was filled with joy. \n\nMbeki hobbled closer to the elephant, they looked at each other. Mbeki raised his hands and hugged the elephant. The elephant wrapped his trunk around Mbeki and lifted him off the ground and once again Mbeki could stare into those wise old elephant eyea. \n\nSuddenly the elephant threw Mbeki hard onto the ground and stamped on Mbeki's head three time killing him. \n\nIt was a different elephant.",ai,ai_1691,0,0,1

"Old School Pirate Crime

Captain Normal Beard the up-and-coming pirate captain and his first mate Clumsy Edward were in desperate need of ink in order to make the numerous treasure maps they were sure create during all of their treasure-filled journeys. More than anything they needed red ink for the illustrious X's that will mark the location of the unbound riches of their future. A well known calligrapher lived in the area and Clumsy Edward knew just how to get their much-needed red ink! \n \""Put ye hands out and I can vault into the window he keeps open, Cap'n. In an out real quick-like, sir! Ink an everything!\"" \n Clumsy Edward's plan was foolproof. The night had come and Captain Normal Beard and Clumsy Edward were outside the calligrapher's home. All according to plan, the window the duo had planned to use was open and the home was dark. Normal Beard interlocked his fingers as if he'd done it hundreds of times before and Edward was in the window in no time. \n Here's where the issue arises. \n Clumsy Edward, claiming his name once again, had only put enough forethought into the operation to get into the window. He was unaware of the layout of the small one-room home the calligrapher lived in. He was incredibly unaware that the calligrapher did all of his work right under the window and that he had neglected to put away his work from earlier the night. Clumsy Edward falls through the window and lands onto the table with a loud crash, alerting the neighboring citizens. \""Argh, I done crash't into the table an spill't the ink, Cap'n! I'm cover't innit!\""\nUpon hearing the commotion a nearby group of men ran to the scene to find Clumsy Edward leaving the home covered in ink. Black ink on his face. Blue across his entire torso. Red ink covering his arms and hands. \nUnfortunately, Clumsy Edward and Captain Normal Beard's dream to be wealthy pirates was known to the community and no one believed that Clumsy Edward would do something of his own fruition. \nAfter the fallout of their plan, Captain Normal Beard went to the local tavern to attempt to drown his sorrows unaware of the fate that befell his matey. \n Mid-drink Clumsy Edward was thrown into the tavern followed by his captors. Upon making eye contact with his Captain, Edward immediately and profusely apologized. Seeing this, Edward's captors seized Captain Normal Beard and showed him the evidence against him. The black ink on Edward's face. The Blue in across his torso. And finally, the red ink covering his arms and hands. \""We believe Edward here to have broken into the calligrapher's home with your instruction, Normal Beard. What do ye say to these accusations?\"" \n Captain Normal Beard was completely stunned, unable to come up with a good reason for their predicament. \nNormal Beard knew that he and his matey had been caught and they would surely hang for destruction and theft.

"Aboriginal Rituals

A couple years back, I stumbled on a surprising reference to the astonishing longevity of Aboriginal shamans living in the Australian outback. Reliable birth records aren't available before the early 20th century, but government officials have noted an astounding number of nonagenarians and centenarians. And anthropologists report--but, of course, discount--stories of village elders living for 150 years, 200 years, or more.\n\nThere are weirder stories, incredible enough to be consigned to footnotes in academic texts: that the shaman of Jimbilum arrived in that community in 1872, already impossibly old, and was dispensing advice, justice, and herbal remedies well until the late 1990s. His cause of death is assumed to be exposure: he left the village one night and was never seen again. Implausibly, residents of Ngunulum claim that their shaman--who, again, departed without a word, some time in early 1960s--claimed to have been personally acquainted with William Dampier, a man who last set foot in Australia in 1688.\n\nI try to be careful with extreme claims, so I'm not going to say that every Aboriginal shaman is immortal. I will, though, go so far as to say that there's not a single verifiable case of one of them dying.\n\nIt gets stranger.\n\nLike many traditional faith healers, shamans follow a number of special rules and taboos. You have the usual prayers, incantations, and prohibitions, and one especially odd dietary fixation: shamans insist on drinking a broth made by boiling water and adding chunks of koala meat.\n\nThis is not a minor rule. The departure of the shaman of Jimbilum, for example, coincided with the Australian Department of Environment's launching of a poaching investigation. Ngunulum's spiritual leader left after a long drought led to the death of the region's last remaining koalas.\n\nThere is no record of an Aboriginal shaman dying; there is no record of an Aboriiginal shaman going a day without drinking water that's been steeped in koala flesh and boiled.\n\nI had to investigate.\n\nYou're familiar with the Dark Web, right? (Don't kid me--of course you are.) I opened an account on one of the lesser-known sites, one that ignored narcotics and credit cards, in favor of more exotic goods. For .275 bitcoin (shipping included), I had a sample of freshly-harvested koala meat en route.\n\nAfter two weeks, I was pretty sure I'd been had. And pretty sure I deserved it, too. How much time and money should a grown adult spend investigating third-hand reports--and violating endangered species laws on several continents, to boot?\nBut then, on Monday, a package arrived. Lumpy, misshappen, sealed with three different kinds of tape, it felt strangely heavy and cool to the touch.\n\nI opened it.\n\nThe roiling steam looked a lot less dramatic when I realized that, obviously, when you ship meat intercontinentally, you pack it with dry ice.\n\nThe koala looks smaller on your kitchen counter than it looks in pictures. I've seen lots of pictures of koalas, and always thought they looked cute, but never tasty. The impression doesn't improve in person.\n\nBut it was too late to turn back. I'd already set some water to boil. I stashed most of the koala in the freezer, and sliced off a toe.\n\nIn 1927, anthropologist Ursula McConnel recorded a list of rituals of the Wik Mungkan. Among them, the ceremonial boiling of a water infused with koala bits. Exactly 1.2 liters, exactly 3 hours. I followed her recipe to the letter.\n\nAnd it was DISGUSTING. The foulest, nastiest thing I'd ever tasted. It coats your tongue and lacerates your nostrils and the taste stays with you for hours and the memory is with me still. If this was the route to immortality, maybe dying was a better option.\n\nBut I wasn't finished with my research. I pored over my books and papers, looking for more information on the ritual, and found that it was, in fact, permissible to fiddle with the recipe. Shamans in different regions had different spins on the concoction: as long as you boiled the water long enough, and used genuine koala, the other ingredients didn't matter.\n\nAfter some experimentation, I've found exactly the right mix of flavorings to make it about as tasty as any other beverage.\n\nI guess you could say this really improved my koala tea of life.",ai,ai_5400,0,0,1

Instead of chicken and fries, it was big ass fruits!! It was too much and after two weeks , John saw God passing by. He said : Hey God! God! Can i ask you something?

"A girl walks into a tattoo parlor and explains that she's always wanted a tattoo of her favorite country music star on the inside of her thigh...

She's really conflicted though, because she can't decide between her two favorites, Conway Twitty or George Jones. The tattoo artist offers a solution: he would do both Conway Twitty AND George Jones, one on each thigh, for only $200 with a free money-back guarantee...if she doesn't like his work, she doesn't have to pay. She agrees that's a hell of a deal, so she hops up in the chair, hikes up her skirt and the tattoo artist goes straight to work. He works with dedication and concentration throughout most of the day, first on one thigh and then the other. Hours pass before he finally finishes. He stands up and admires his work and holding a mirror between the girl's knees, he asks her what she thinks of the two tattoos. ""That looks nothing like Conway Twitty OR George Jones,"" the girl shouts, ""and I'm not paying you one damn dollar!"" ""The hell you're not,"" replied the tattoo artist, ""this is some of the best work I've ever done!"" ""BULLSHIT!"" screams the girl, ""I ain't paying!"" The artist has an idea. ""Tell you what,"" he says, ""let's put it to a vote. We'll go outside and ask the first person we see what they think of the tattoos. If they can recognize Conway & George, you're paying! If not, they're free."" The girl agrees, and the two walk outside. There happens to be a homeless man, clearly drunk and sitting on the sidewalk outside the tattoo shop, and the tattoo artist approaches him and explains their predicament and asks the man to judge the tattoos to see if he can recognize who they are. The homeless man agrees to help, so the girl walks over to where he is sitting, lifts her skirt and opens her legs in the man's face so he can get a good look at the two tattoos.

The other week I was in the aquarium having a whale of a time (pardon the pun). I saw sea horses, sharks, turtles, the whole shebang. But I couldn't wait to get to my favourite creature. I don't know why but I've always been fascinated by eels. I did a project on them in primary school and since then they've just stuck with me. I can name every single breed of them without even trying. So I get to the eel section which is crowded beyond belief. I mean I love eels but most people just kind of glance at them on the way to the stingrays. Today there were so many people there I couldn't even see the tank. I managed to push myself to the front, accidentally shoving a toddler, and saw what all the fuss was about. There they were, all swimming about, hidingin crevices, doing what eels do best. Except one. I couldn't actually believe it but right in the middle of the tank there was an eel. Biggest eel in there. And it was singing. Clear as day it was singing. I don't know how we were all hearing it through the glass and the water but we could see its mouth moving perfectly with the words. It even hummed some of the music at one point so I know it wasn't a trick. It only sang the one song though, this old love song that I can't remember the name of. It's really popular though,used in loads of movies, especially ones about Italy. I couldn't believe it, I'd never seen an eel do this before. I knew so much about eels and yet I'd never heard of this kind before. I managed to spot an employee on the other side of the room and struggled my way over. I somehow got his attention over the noise of all the people and the singing eel. ""How the hell does an eel know that song? How is it able to sing? What kind of eel is it?"" And he turned to me and went ""oh that's a moray""",human,342d8e,11,1430163251,0

We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh, my God, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. It's terrible. It's just terrible.

A young man named John received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird’s mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity.\n\nJohn tried and tried to change the bird’s attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to ‘clean up’ the bird’s vocabulary.\n\nFinally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even more rude. John, in desperation, threw up his hand, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer.\n\nFor a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute. Fearing that he’d hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John’s outstretched arms and said “I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I’m sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.”\n\nJohn was stunned at the change in the bird’s attitude.

"So why did the chicken cross the road?

SARAH PALIN: The chicken crossed the road because, gosh-darn it, he's a maverick! BARACK OBAMA: Let me be perfectly clear, if the chickens like their eggs they can keep their eggs. No chicken will be required to cross the road to surrender her eggs. Period. JOHN McCAIN: My friends, the chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road. HILLARY CLINTON: What difference at this point does it make why the chicken crossed the road? GEORGE W. BUSH: We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either with us or against us. There is no middle ground here. DICK CHENEY: Where's my gun? BILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken. AL GORE: I invented the chicken. JOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it. AL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white? DR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he is acting by not taking on his current problems before adding any new problems. OPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross the road so badly. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a NEW CAR so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens. ANDERSON COOPER: We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road. NANCY GRACE: That chicken crossed the road because he's guilty! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks. PAT BUCHANAN: To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American. MARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way the chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information. DR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told. ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die in the rain, alone. GRANDPA: In my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us. BARBARA WALTERS: Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its lifelong dream of crossing the road. ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road. BILL GATES: I have just released eChicken2014, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken2014. This new platform is much more stable and will never reboot.

A man moved to a Polish neighborhood in Chicago, and fell in love with the community because everyone was so nice, happy and good looking. Upon his next doctor’s visit, he asked, “Doctor, how do I become Polish?

Upon waking up in the recovery room, the doctor was there to deliver some troubling news. “I’m sorry sir, there was a mistake.

"The Mexican president has a rare cancer of the brain and is in need of a brain transplant. His only option is a risky new procedure that his doctor recently perfected.

He now has to “shop” for his brain. \n\n“Sir, as this is a new procedure, our pool of brains you can choose from is rather small. Prices of the brains will vary,” said the doctor. \n\n“Okay, show me what you’ve got. I have an important job, so I’ll need the best brain,” replies the president. \n\n“A South Korean brain will cost you $80,000.” \n\nThe Mexican president widens his eyes in shock at the price. But then thinks that yes, the Koreans are smart people. It is quite understandable that a brain from there would be costly. \n\n“A brain from China would cost $15.000,” the doc continued, “an American one would cost $2,500, and las-“\n\n“HAH!” The president interrupted. “And those dumb Americans are always looking down on us. Look at their cheap ass brains!” The Mexican president smirks to himself. \n\n“As I was saying,” continued the doctor, “ lastly, a Mexican brain would cost $150,000.”\n\nImmediately, the president’s chest swells with pride, thinking what great minds his country has. \n\n“I’ll take the Mexican brain!” He exclaims, almost with a tear in his eye. \n\nAfter the operation, when the president is recovering, he begins to wonder and asks how the brains were priced. \n\n“Ah, you see, China has no shortage of brains from people getting terminated for unknown reasons. However, censorship and propaganda limits and degrades the brain somewhat. Hence the lower price. The Americans gorge their minds on social media, low quality entertainment and useless things like conspiracy theories. This combination really harms their brains, and the nonsense their president spouts also exacerbates this,” the doc adds with a slight smile. \n\n“What about Mexican brains? They’re the most expensive and therefore the best, right?” \n\n“Yes. They are the freshest minds with the most potential because most of them have never been used and are good as new.”",ai,ai_2615,0,0,1

A man walks into a bar and the bar keeper says ""Can I get you a drink?"" The man looks at the barkeep and says ""If I can show you the most amazing thing you've ever seen, will you give me free drinks for the rest of the night?"" The barkeep thinks about it for a moment and says ""Sounds interesting but I warn you that I'm not easily impressed. Lets see it then"". The man reaches into his bag an produces a tiny, perfect piano and a stool. The barkeep admires the craftsmanship and says ""Cool toy but I'm not into doll houses"". The man raises a finger of acknowledgement and reaches back into his bag before producing a dwarf hamster dressed in a tiny tuxedo and places it gently onto the stool. ""Cute,"" says the barkeep ""but I've seen better"". The man feeds a sunflower seed to the hamster and after stuffing it into his cheek the hamster turns to the piano and starts to play some of the most beautiful music the barkeep has ever heard. ""Wow"" says the wide eyed barkeep ""That's pretty good, but I've seen better."" The man lets out an exasperated sigh and reaches deeper into his bag before producing a big green frog and sitting it on the bar next to the hamster and his piano. The barkeep raises an eyebrow as the man bends down and appears to whisper something to the hamster before handing over two seeds. The hamster gleefully stuffs the seeds into its mouth before striking up a different tune on the piano and as if by magic the frog starts singing the most sonorous and powerful operatic performance in time with the piano. By this point a crowd of stunned onlookers has gathered around the bar, the barkeep can't believe the spectacle taking place in front of his eyes and as soon as the performance finishes he turns to the man and says ""That's incredible, your drinks are on the house"". The man orders a beer and starts to carefully put the show back in his bag. The barkeep returns with his order and says ""Look, I'd be a fool if I didn't ask if you could be tempted into selling your little show, how much do you want for it? The man sips his beer and replies politely ""Sorry, the creatures are my pets and I won't sell them"" before moving to a corner table for the rest of the evening where he quietly enjoys his free beers by himself. The night eventually draws to a close and the barkeep rings the bell for last orders. The man returns to the bar to order a final drink, the memory of that show has been twirling around the barkeeps mind all night and as he returns with the mans order he decides to make one last offer. ""I know you said they weren't for sale but I've got $2000 worth of tips upstairs that I was saving, it's obvious you've got no money otherwise you'd not be making deals in bars like this so how about it, can we make a deal?"" He says to the man. The man takes a big sip of his beer and looks into space as if deep in thought. After a moment he sighs deeply and says ""Well, I'm trying to get to the big city where I can make some real money but things are getting pretty tight on the road and the show's not worth anything if I never make to the big city at all so I guess we can talk"". The man reaches into his bag and puts the ensemble back on the bar where he sits and studies them while mumbling quietly to himself about years, numbers, training and occasionally counting on his fingers. He eventually stops, takes a deep breath and begins to explain. ""Well the piano took me 4yrs to build and several hundred in materials so that's off the table straight away, the hamster took 5yrs to train and has been a well mannered, loyal friend on the road and I don't think I could part with him but the frog has only been with me for a year and has been foul mouthed and nothing but trouble so I potentially be tempted to offload him for just a little bit more. I'm not a fool and I know what these creatures are worth."" The barkeep ponders this for a moment before disappearing upstairs and returning with the jar of tips, he places it on the bar and opens the cash register, he counts out another $500 and pushes the money towards the man. ""$2500 should take you anywhere in the country first class, it's yours for the frog."" The man looks pained for a moment and stares at the frog before looking at the cash, he looks back and forth a few times trying to make his decision before eventually saying ""Deal"" and tucking the money into his bag. ""Great!"" says the barkeep ""A pleasure doing business with you"". The man takes one long last look at the frog before walking towards the exit. As he proceeds an elderly patron who had been watching them all evening gets up and follows him out the door. ""Excuse me"" the patron says ""Could you hold on a minute?"" ""Sure, what's up?"" say the man. ""I just wanted a final look at the stupidest man on earth as he parts with his fortune!"" sneers the elderly man ""You could have made millions with that little show of yours!"" ""Yeah I do kinda feel like a dick, I should've-"" The man starts to reply ""You should feel like a dick!"" The old patron interrupts ""You should have thought about the big picture, you kids these days never thi-"" The man reaches up and gently presses a finger to the old patrons lips silencing him.

"Two hillbillies walk into a restaurant

🤪😂🤪🤣 Two hillbillies walk into a restaurant. While having a bite to eat, they talk about their moonshine operation. Suddenly, a woman at a nearby table, who is eating a sandwich, begins to cough. After a minute or so, it becomes apparent that she is in real distress. One of the hillbillies looks at her and says, ""Kin ya swallar?"" The woman shakes her head no.

"The tale of Louise.

Once upon a time there was a 7-year-old girl named Louise. Now from a young age Louise had always had an interest in science. Someday she wanted to be an astronaut, to pilot a spaceship, and to explore alien worlds, but she didn't have time for any of those things. You see, Louise's family owned this farm, and any time Louise wanted to, say, build a model spaceship or \""plot her Mars base\"" (complete with a room that was filled with kitty cats!), as she would often do, her father would say \""Sorry, Louise, there's manure to scoop.\"" and she would have to go and shovel manure. So Louise would go and she'd shovel the manure. \n\nLouise had a secret, however. She had discovered this secret the day after her older sister moved out. One of the walls in her room could slide back to reveal a hidden room. Inside this room she kept all her \""space gear\"": space goggles, a map of the solar system, a series of stories she wrote about this alien race she made up and all the hell that would break loose when humans encounter them. \n\nToday was Louise's 14th birthday, and she was tired of shoveling manure. Louise wanted nothing more than to finally speak her mind. She wanted to become a scientist, not work on some farm for the rest of her life. Her parents were eventually persuaded. When she was 18 she left and went to college, got a master's degree in astrophysics, and got a job at NASA.\n\nLouise eventually met a fantastic man named Matt and they fell in love. Within three years they were married and they had one child, a girl named Cassie. Cassie was also interested in science and, of course, her parents were far more allowing of that than Louise's had been.\n\nBut all was not perfect. Matt, unfortunately, was killed in a car crash when Cassie was 10. Louise did her best to raise her child on her own.\n\nCassie went on to discover a strange new species of rabbit found deep underground. They were quite intelligent, and they could breathe without needing oxygen. Cassie had the idea that these rabbits could be used to explore Mars. And soon, Mike and Jake, two space rabbits, were sent out on a mission to Mars.\n\nMike and Jake, while piloting the spaceship, discovered that there was a stowaway on their ship. Who could it be? \n\nThey looked around. \n\nThen they searched some more.\n\nThe stowaway was hard to find, but eventually they found him, a rabbit named Kevin. Now Kevin was very annoying, and he annoyed the crap out of Mike and Jake while they tried to make it to Mars. Still, there was nothing the two NASA rabbits could do, they were pretty close to approaching Mars and their best option was just to go with it.\n\nSo the three space rabbits landed on Mars eventually. Mike was excited, Jake was kinda scared, and Kevin had resorted to singing \""1000 bottles of beer on the wall\"". They wandered around the planet rather aimlessly for a while, with nothing to really report. They traveled and traveled and traveled and it seemed like they had been there for an eternity. Eventually, the rabbits heard a strange noise with their large rabbit ears.\n\n*thump thump thump thump thump*\n\nThey wondered what that noise could be and started to make their way towards it. Eventually the sound grew louder.\n\n*THUMP THUMP THUMP*\n\nAnd eventually it sounded like... a beat? Music perhaps?\n\n*T H U M P T H U M P T H U M P T H U M P*\n\nAnd... they saw it. A silhouette over the horizon. It looked like a rock. No, it was a house. A house? On Mars? Kevin was still annoying as ever and now down to \""4 bottles of beer on the wall\"".\n\nThey traveled closer to the house. It was definitely a house. A giant mansion of a house. And it was packed to the brim with martians having a party of some sort. \n\nThere were martians in the pool, martians on the roof, martians dead on the pavement. The space rabbits were hungry after their long trip and decided to grab some pizza at this party. But the line to get the pizza was RIDICULOUSLY long. It went upstairs, downstairs again, out the door and around the house at least five times. They gave up on getting pizza. What rabbits eat pizza anyways? So they decided to get some snacks. Chips, pretzels, and the like. But this line was even longer. It went upstairs, downstairs again, out the door and around the house at least ten times. The rabbits were famished and parched. Then, they saw it. They saw it at last. Adventurous Louise, spirited Cassie, and obnoxious Kevin had all led up to this moment. This moment when they could be the first rabbits to set foot on Mars, and, while on Mars consume a fruity drink. Do you know why? Well, there was no punch line.\n\n^^sorry",ai,ai_5012,0,0,1

"A store that sells new husbands has opened in New York City, where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building! \n\nSo, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: \n\nFloor 1 - These men Have Jobs. She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads: \n\nFloor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids. 'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.' So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:\n\nFloor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking. 'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.\n\nFloor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework. 'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!' Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: \n\nFloor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak. \nShe is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:\n\nFloor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. \n\nThank you for shopping at the Husband Store.\n\nNaturally some bright spark opens A New Wives store. \n\nFloor 1 - Has wives that love sex. \n\nFloor 2 - Has wives that love sex, have money and like beer. \n\nThe remaining floors have never been visited.

"Everyone needs a little relaxation time once in a while [Long]

So my friend and I decided to unwind and visit this Day Spa that she highly recommended. I had never heard of it before and asked her what was so great about it. However she refused to tell me why it was so good. So we scheduled a visit for the following Sunday and when we arrived I realised why I’d never heard of it before. It was literally named ‘Day Spa’ When we arrived we were greeted by this pretty looking receptionist who checked us in and directed us to a dressing room to get changed into the spa provided dressing gowns. We left our things in a nearby locker and walked deeper into the spa. At this point my friend has this huge grin on her face and finally decides to tell me why this place is so good. She explains that there are 26 different rooms of treatment each labelled A-Z and each specialising in different treatments from foot rubs to full body massages to hot stones. So we agreed to split up and meet back up in 2 hours. The first room I go into is room A. It’s quiet, and the only thing in the room is a single seat with an A engraved on it as well as a curtain. So I sit down and almost instantly this beautiful woman pops out from behind the curtain and starts placing various hot towels on different parts of my body. 15 mins later she takes them away and I get off of the seat, thoroughly relaxed and a lot less tense. Next I go into room F and, just like in room A there sits a single seat with the letter F engraved on it. I take a seat and hear a clanking sound beneath me. Before I can wonder what it is, the floor suddenly sinks into a circular hole. I was quite startled, that is until the hole started filling with warm water and the air was filled with a sweet, thick aroma. ‘Herbal bath’ I realised. ‘Not bad’ Another 30 minutes pass and I decide I want to try something else, so I go to stand up but at that moment the floor starts to rise again and the water sinks back into the floor. ‘Neat’ I think to myself. I try a few other rooms and they’re all pretty similar at first glance with the seats being engraved with whatever room number they were in. That is until is get to room O, where I see a big line has formed with people waiting excitedly at the door. I spot my friend at the end of the line and ask her why everyone’s so eager to get into this room. She tells me that this is the best room in the entire day spa and that people sometimes book months in advance to reserve the seat. After 30 minutes or so of queueing, it’s my friend’s turn, 5 minutes later she comes out with the most relaxed and calm look on her face. I ask her what happened but she just winks at me and said I’ll “find out” I walk into the room and excitedly sit myself on seat O. Suddenly, a team of masseuses walk out from behind the curtain and begin to massage all over my body. They use hot wax, stones, towels, and every type of lotion and ointment I can recognise, and many I can’t. The music is also stunning, with angelic choirs and lustrous saxophones playing softly in the back ground 5 minutes later I meet my friend outside and we leave the day spa, feeling utterly calm and relaxed. About a week later, some other friends of mine are discussing ways they like to relax. One of them says that music helps her unwind, another says she uses walks through the forest. They turn to me and ask what I use to relax. I reply: Day Spa, Seat O.",human,8yccld,6,1531420026,0

I mean, she mastiff had to pinch-‘er self.\n\n“Concert for dogs now Lou? I know you’re avant-garde but what’s the pointer that?”\n\nBut Lou Reed soon set-'er straight. He said “Sch-nau-zer’s a time and a place for complaining; this is a great opportunity for us dear. I terrier, we can’t basset up! I’ll put a band together and whippet into shape.”\n\n“Okay” she said, “But make sure it’s a cosmopolitan band. Get an English guy on drums and someone from Tehran on rhythm guitars…”\n\n“Hang on love, I’ll just write that down: Pom, Iranian. Anyone else?”\n\n“Yup. For backing vocals get the lead singer from that influential synth-pop band Kraftwerk. And, er, maybe the famous American actress and occasional singer who starred in Moonlighting.”\n\n“Okay, German, Shepard.”\n\n“And on drums…”\n\n“Hang on” interrupted Lou Reed, “Dachshund-ough.”\n\nThe preparations then began and they started to pack their bags. Lou said “Oh no, I can’t find that lovely knitted sweater I bought when I did that gig in Dublin.”\n\nLaurie, his wife, soon located it, “here it is Lou, Irish-wool-found. By the way, did you find our annoying neighbour's skillet that you borrowed?”\n\n“Fucking Carl’s-pan.-Yeah-I’ll take it ‘round later.”\n\n“Make sure him or his misses is there when you give it back, Dal-make-sure-no one’ll say we’ve still got it.”\n\nSoon Laurie was ready to go, “H-Okay,-do-you mind if I tell my friend? You know the lady from number 35, who you really don’t like.”\n\n“What, shit-Sue?”\n\n“I wish you wouldn’t call her that dear. It’s very rude. And anyway, why don’t you like her?”\n\n“Well, ‘cause she talks rot-while-her huge husband scares me. I mean he’s a big-old bastard. Last time I told her about one of my gigs she just talked about it endlessly at work; she really bored-her-colleagues.”\n\nThey climbed into their car to go to the airport to Australia.\n\n“Wow” said Laurie “I’ve had such a great day ‘n’-it’s-only still lunchtime.\n\n“Hang on” said Lou suddenly, “we better do some publicity for this gig. Can I borrow 20 bucks for some posters for it?”\n\n“Sure-pay-me back next week” replied his wife, “and get me a box of chocolates to say thanks. My purse is on the backseat, I’ll just reach-back and get it.\""\n\n“Have you told any of your old music buddies about it? Has-Keith Richards called?”\n\n“No” said Lou, “but I told ex-Velvet’s drummer Maureen Tucker all about it. I really talked it up.”\n\n“Did-you-wow-‘er?”\n\n“I sure did wow her; She was well impressed” said Lou. “I’m so excited about this gig. If it goes well, I want to take this show to dogs all around the world.”\n\n“Well let’s just see how it goes first, love” cautioned his wife, “Don’t start thinking about an elaborate-tour.”\n\n“Not yet, it’s going to be a logistical challenge anyway. I mean, for a start, won’t they have to clean the auditorium – not after a crowd of dogs has poo-ed all over it.”\n\n“And, if any promoter asked you to do a gig for cats, I would be hesitant.

This-a last thing I wanted to see.”\n\nAs they pulled into the airport, they drove past a textile maker who’d fallen into the icy Hudson River and just climbed out.\n\n“Look darling,” said Lou Reed, “it’s a cold-and-wet-weaver.”\n\nAndy Zaltzman; total: 31 dog puns",ai,ai_4906,0,0,1

...They set out to find a new homeland for their brand of Christianity. They left Vermont with little to their name, only the clothes on their backs and a song in their heart. As they traveled, they would sing for their meals. In these days there weren’t what we would consider restaurants, but instead people would gather at the local public house. \n Since our missionaries were, well, religious, their peak performances would occur Sunday mornings, when they were thinking the most about the glory of God. As they moved forward in their travels, word preceded them from town to town, so it came to be that when they would get to a new town, they would be inundated with requests for this hymn or that. In many towns, the people had little to give the performers, and the chorus would simply request an apple for each of the singers.

He told her he couldn't stop and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor. She was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.\n\nThe years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her.\n\nShe took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.\n\nSome time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom.\n\nThe wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good.\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face.\n\nShe bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, \""Honey, you were right. All these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.\n\n\""What do you mean?\"" asked his wife.\n\n\""Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and these two fingers, I think I got them all back in.",ai,ai_4707,0,0,1

"'Economic Stimulus' payment

Sometime this year, we taxpayers will again receive another 'Economic Stimulus' payment. This is indeed a very exciting program, and I'll explain it by using a Q & A format: Q. What is an 'Economic Stimulus' payment ? A. It is money that the federal government will send to taxpayers. Q.. Where will the government get this money ? A. From taxpayers. Q. So the government is giving me back my own money ? A. Only a smidgen of it. Q. What is the purpose of this payment ? A. The plan is for you to use the money to purchase a high-definition TV set, thus stimulating the economy. Q. But isn't that stimulating the economy of China ? A. Shut up. Below is some helpful advice on how to best help the U.S. economy by spending your stimulus check wisely: * If you spend the stimulus money at Wal-Mart, the money will go to China or Sri Lanka . * If you spend it on gasoline, your money will go to the Arabs. * If you purchase a computer, it will go to India , Taiwan or China . * If you purchase fruit and vegetables, it will go to Mexico , Honduras and Guatemala ... * If you buy an efficient car, it will go to Japan or Korea . * If you purchase useless stuff, it will go to Taiwan . * If you pay your credit cards off, or buy stock, it will go to management bonuses and they will hide it offshore. Instead, keep the money in America by: 1) Spending it at yard sales, or 2) Going to ball games, or 3) Spending it on prostitutes, or 4) Beer or 5) Tattoos. (These are the only American businesses still operating in the U.S. ) Conclusion: Go to a ball game with a tattooed prostitute that you met at a yard sale and drink beer all day !

"A dalmatian is very confused.

He doesn't know if he's a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots. He is asking his friends to see if they can help him. He goes to Squirrel and asks ""Squirrel, am I a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots?"" The squirrel looks up to him and says in her squirrely voice ""That's a good question, I don't know."" The dalmatian then approaches his friend the cat and asks him the same question: ""Cat, am I a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots?"" The cat responds, ""Beats me"" and walks away. The dalmatian is walking down the street contemplating his conundrum and is wondering if there is anyone else he can ask, when BAM he gets hit by a truck and dies. He goes to Doggy Heaven and is greeted by Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates. Peter welcomes the dog to Heaven and gives him a quick overview of the place. He finishes and asks if Dalmatian has any questions. ""Yes!"" the dalmatian said excitedly. ""This question has been bothering me for the longest time and I need to know. Am I a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots?"" Saint Peter quizzically looks up as he thinks, then shakes his head as he replies, ""I don't know. BUT, what you can do is go in and ask the big guy yourself. Go down this hall and he's at the very last door."" ""Wow thanks!"" says Dalmatian. He gets to the last room, knocks and enters. God asks how he can help. The dalmatian timidly asks his question: ""Am I a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots?"" Without missing a beat, God responds in a booming voice, ""You are what you are."" Satisfied, the dog leaves. Upon exiting, Saint Peter asks, ""Well, did you get your answer?"" ""Yes I did!"" the dalmatian says with confidence. ""God said 'You are what you are', that means I am a white dog with black spots. If I was a black dog with white spots, God would have said 'You is what you is.""",human,3zqp4g,2,1452100119,0

The third floor sign reads: Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking. 'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework. 'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!' Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak. She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads: Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. Naturally some bright spark opens A New Wives store.

A girl was starting to study for her AP exams, and her parents bought her a new calculator to help her out. The next day, she took the calculator in to class and started using it. The moment she started hitting the keys, she heard a guitar playing country music. Startled, she stopped and put it back in her bag. During a break, she investigated further. She keyed in 2+2 and the guitar started again. That’s odd, she thought, but I’m sure it’s nothing. It’s just a little annoying. She went on to do her homework with the device, but by the end of the day, she was so sick of it playing music that she decided to take it to a service shop. “Can I help you?” asked the employee. “My parents gave this to me yesterday. It’s brand new, but I think there’s something wrong with it,” she said as she handed the calculator over. The employee pressed a few buttons and guitar began. When he stopped, the music stopped as well. “What’s the problem?” he asked. This took the girl by surprise. “Well, it’s the music.” “Okay,” replied the employee. This has to be a joke, she thought, and continued: “I started doing addition and subtraction and it started playing some country music.” “Okay,” he replied again. “And then I tried multiplication and division, and I know this sounds crazy, but a fiddle joined in.” “Right.” “By the time I got to my actual calculus work, I swear it was playing zydeco!” “Well, I don’t really see the problem then,” he said, handing it back. “It’s not going to sing for you.

"The Last Ride

""Congratulations! You can now handle this route on your own. Remember the company's protocol"", Bobbie beamed as he finished assessing Dave's performance for Bus Service 13. ""Enjoy the night events following the route"", Bobbie mischievously hinted at Dave, his junior who had just joined the company. Today, Dave steeled his nerves. He will be on his own, handling the midnight ""last bus"" schedule for Service 13, a long but important service, as it serviced a massive industrial area. Of course it's a bustling service in the day, with workers to and fro. As part of regulation, the company has to operate the service even till midnight where there's usually no passengers. Oddly, his only assignment will be to drive this service at this timing, and nothing else. Noone else in the company was jealous of his work but Dave cast aside those thoughts. Satisfied with the initial inspection of the double-decker bus, he started on his journey from the depot. With only the scenes of forest edges flying by, he examined quiet roads and empty pathways but an eerie feeling crept up as he passed a dilapidated graveyard. The government planned to exhume the site to pave way for more industrial projects, or at least that was what he had read in the papers. Approaching the start of the industrial area, he wondered if there'll be anyone boarding the bus. As expected, there was noone in the multitude of bus-stops he passed. As the last few factories loomed before him, he noticed someone at a bus-stop. It was an old lady, dressed simply in a white dress, her dishevelled hair blocking her face, but two things were apparent. She held out her hand flagging the bus but her eyes were transfixed on something above. Specifically, the upper deck of the bus. Dave slowed down, feeling slightly nervous and as he approaches, the figure maintained her position but her gaze never strayed. Confident that the person was physically there, he stopped and the woman boarded, her face distraught. ""I have never seen so many people up there at this time, it must be because today's Friday the 13th"", she shivered. Dave was dumbfounded as she took her seat beside the stairwell leading to the upper deck. Indeed today was Friday 13th as he eyed the woman through the rear view mirror. She was 5 seats away from him but her fear was contagious. Dave had goosebumps as he pulled off. ""I'm sorry madam, but what do you mean people up there? You're the first passenger"", Dave inquired, trying to quench his curiousity. ""Nothing nothing! I can hear them stomping above as though they're trying to shush me"", the woman squeaked as she clasped her hand in prayer. Dave was mortified. He kept looking at the CCTV monitor panel but there was noone in the upper decks. His fear was somewhat relieved as they entered the residential zone and 13 stops later, the woman buzzed the stop. Dave couldn't believe his eyes when the woman ran fleeing out of the bus at her stop. Her face displayed pure agony as she turned back for the last time to look at the bus before disappearing into the shadows of the houses. Dave controlled his breathing and continued driving. It was only a few stops away till the final depot, so he must see this journey to the end. Still, he kept peeking at the CCTV monitors to be sure but nothing happened as he ended his work for the day. Dave didn't tell anyone what happened as he turned up for work the next day. Perhaps it was an anomaly, there was no point in looking like a mad man after just a day's work. He checked the bus and headed out for the journey. The same start as yesterday and again at the same stop, there appeared the lady again. She looked the same, save for her change of clothes but still her gaze was transfixed on the upper deck. ""Today's less busy... but there's a hulking presence amongst them"", she whispered as she sat further way from Dave, nearer the exit doors. Chill went down his spine. Was there a murderous intent above that he didn't notice? He scanned the monitors just to be safe but he couldn't see anything. Even Dave who didn't believe in the supernatural, was starting to question his beliefs, as he noticed the woman sobbing in her seat. As if a replay of last night's activities, the woman sprung out and ran when they reached her stop. She didn't even look back. These series of events repeated themselves as Dave drove the service for more than a year. He thought he could get used to it but he just couldn't. Different nights, different terrors. It has gotten to the point that the woman now regularly sat on the exit door steps, clutching to the walls, sniffling her cries. ""There's something on the roof"", ""I can hear them trying to go down the stairwells"", ""Stop looking into the upper deck, they're restless"", ""We're damned in this service"", ""I hope you're praying as hard as me, it's the only way to resist"", ""Stop crying and wailing, stop! Stop, I can't help you!!!"", ""God bless me please!"", all manners of horrified speeches were said by the woman, either directed to him or to the dwelling above. ""I pray you are safe!"", ""God bless your soul"", ""Be safe"", sometimes she would say that to Dave before she alighted. Dave hated it when she said parting words because it hinted a terrifying presence. And then one day it stopped. The lady stopped appearing. The same day the government had also begun exhuming the sites and transferring the remains to another mortuary. Dave rue the day he started noticing her absence. She was the only company he had in this damned service route. He kept checking the CCTV above, afraid of the unknown. He started praying from the moment he start the journey. He brought books of faith, talisman, charms and even turned to vegetarian diet to rid himself of bad karma. But whatever he did, the pressure behind him grew and grew. Without the woman, things had started to go awry. He didn't notice them at first but he thought he could start seeing the negativities himself. Flickers in the CCTV monitor, he felt the temperature drop, opposing cars high beamed him, and it started to affect his driving. He would narrowly avoid collision with structures while checking the monitors. He would unconciously speed up and beat red lights when in the vicinity of the violated graveyard. 2 months of this has taken a toll on Dave. He had nightmares every night, images of dark shadows consuming the interior of the bus. In just the short period, Dave had lost a lot of weight, he looked gaunt and his eyes lifeless. His concerned wife pulled him aside and just said she loved him, their children loved him, and if work was the reason he had become like this, he should find another job. Dave spent the morning thinking about this. The job paid well since it was night hours, it was only 1 route and he had never fell ill in the past year, despite his horror experiences. It was only after the lady disappeared that things have taken a physical toll on him. He concluded that she was part of his divine protection. He had made up his mind. He will tender his resignation. In front of his superiors, Dave explained his reasons for quitting. He didn't care if they didn't believed him, and he even turned down their offer for a raise. They must know something, that must be why they want to keep me. Without anyone else wanting to run the midnight bus service 13, the company could face a legal repercussion. In the end, they had to call back Bobbie, the only person who had drove that route before Dave. In fact, Bobbie drove exclusively that route for more than a decade, never taking a day off. Dave took his leave and lo and behold, he met Bobbie outside the office. Bobbie exlaimed his surprise, ""I heard you're resigning? But why?"" ""I couldn't continue working that route after the only passenger, this lady, I don't know anything about her, but after she stopped apeparing, I just don't have the will to continue"", Dave said. ""That's... a damn shame! She was the only reason why I had agreed to come back! My ailing eyesight was why the company transferred me to day shift. But if I had a choice, I would have stayed on service 13! But now that she's gone... it's all over"", Bobbie wept. Bobbie continued hopelessly, ""Now who's gonna accompany me in that night ride..."". ""I understand what you meant Bobbie. In hindsight, she was also the reason why I stayed. She was my protector, my guardian angel"", Dave sighed. ""What the fuck are you talking about?"", quizzed Bobbie suddenly. Dave told his stories to a bewildered Bobbie, who kept quiet the whole time. ""That foxy vixen... I guess she must have retired from her company"" mumbled Bobbie. Noticing the shocked look plastered on Dave's face. Bobbie chuckled, ""I guess she'll really do anything to avoid paying the bus fare"".",human,8dc6qj,1,1524113746,0

"As I type this, I am slowly dying of cancer. This is my story, and I hope whoever reads this takes this as a warning.

I was never one of the cool kids. Ever since I was born I have been, if no better way to put it, average. My mother used to tell me the story of when I was born. Apparently, when I first popped out, I didn't cry, as one would expect a newborn baby to. I simply peered around a bit as the nurses rushed over to take care of me. How's that ""average""? I don't know. It's just a story my mom used to tell me, and I think it sets the stage rather well for what was to come. The days of my innocence flew by, and soon I was about to enter 9th grade. That was when my dad was posted to a new state by his company. Leaving behind my home of nearly 14 years, I stepped into the brave new world of Mississippi. Of course, that meant I enrolled in a new high school. There, lost and alone, I stumbled around until I met my two guys who would become the best friends I would ever have. To cut a long story short, I got to know them in math class. Bored by a particularly dry lecture (something about calculus) we struck a conversation and found that we shared a common interest: We were all crazy into gaming. We talked about the newest Metal Gear, and it all went uphill from there. Their names were Luke and Missile. Luke was a bit of a nerd, but an all-round cool guy, and an amazing friend. If you were in a jam, you could be sure Luke would be there to see you through. Missile, on the other hand, was a wild one; always on the move, and with such an excited and bubbly manner of speaking you could feel yourself getting carried along as he spoke. At first, I thought he was Latino, but turns out he was half-filipino. Oh, and his real name was Gonzales. He just liked being called ""Missile"" (for whatever reason, I do not know. I doubt even he himself really does). So it was with these two that I spent a happy 6 months in high school. My parents seemed to be happy that I was coping well. We lived in a good neighborhood, and our next-door neighbor, a German fellow by the name of Mr Anderson who always wore sunglasses and had a pot belly, would often invite us over for barbecues and such. Luke and Missile would join in on occasion, and we would talk about life, school, and anything really, before popping in Mario Party in Mr Anderson's Wii and playing to our heart's content. Life was going pretty well. Then, I met her. Her name was Trucy, and I will forever remember the day I first laid my eyes on her. It was in art class, and amidst the smell of stale paint and canvas I caught a whiff of perfume. I looked up, and there she was. Beautiful brown curls framed her perfect, blue-eyed face. And that smile. Oh god. I swear I collaped into a dreamy, unmanly heap on the table for the entire lesson which followed. When I met up with Luke and Missile in the cafeteria, my thoughts still dwelled on her. Luke must have sensed that something was going on, because he waved his hand in front of me, saying ""Earth to Arlon, Earth to Arlon, Arlon do you copy"", which snapped me out of my trance-like state. ""What's with you man?"" he asked. ""You're not your usual self today."" ""Oh, Nothing."" I lied. But, of course, they found out eventually. And they were really cool about it. Turns out, Missile knew Trucy from Economics, so with that in mind, we started to brainstorm ideas on how to approach her. Luke suggested we take it slow. ""What about you 'invite' us all to the movies, Missile?"" he said. ""We'll book tickets, then get trucy next to Arlon. We can work it out from there."" We did exactly that, and it turned out pretty well. Better, in fact, than I expected -- we managed to exchange phone numbers. Missile and Luke congratulated me on a job well done, then we went to get Taco Bell. There, we planned our next course of action. Over the next few weeks, Trucy and I got to know each other, whether through phone calls or the clandestine operations Luke and Missile helped me arrange. Soon, I didn't need their help anymore, and we went on our first date together at a park (yes, very creative I know). It was then that I knew I had to tell her. ""Trucy?"" ""Yes Arlon?"" ""There's something... i need to tell you."" ""What is it?"" I hesitated. Then, I saw them. Sitting on a bench reading newspapers. Cheeky bastards, turns out they had arranged this too? Luke smiled and gave me a thumbs-up while Missile mouthed ""Just do it."" So I did it. ""I... I kinda like you, hehe"" (it probably sounded even more awkward than it does here) ""Oh, Arlon"" And we shared our first kiss. I was in heaven. My heaven would last through the three years we dated. Then, just when I thought our relationship was truly budding, we broke up. Yes, it was that abrupt. Trucy loved someone else now, and I was left behind. The feeling in my chest that I experienced that day, cannot be described in words. Suffice to say, I was devastated, heartbroken. I went home the day she broke up with me without speaking a word to anyone. When I got home, I shut the door and tried to rationalise with myself. ""It's ok Arlon. You'll manage. There are plenty other girls out there"" ""Don't be sad Arlon. it was not meant to be."" But the more I thought about it, the worse I felt. Over the next few days, Luke and Missile tried to talk me out of it, tried to make me forget it, get it over with. But it did not help. I slipped further and further into depression. Yes, I started hanging out late and doing drugs. Yes, I started doing alcohol. I went from respectable, generally nice guy to a coke-snorting, chain-smoking hobo. But through all this, Luke and Missile stood by me. Shame on me that I didn't appreciate them then. I remember once, I, in a drunken stupor, smashed a bottle and used it to stab Missile, who was trying to stop me from drinking so much ( and probably get alcohol poisoning). That was the end of it between me and Missile. I tried committing suicide once. I climbed to the top of the roof and jumped down. I got caught in some tree branches and ended up on the ground with only a gash across my leg. I cursed the heavens loudly for letting me survive. Mr Anderson, alerted by the noise, quickly brought me in and wrapped up my wound. I sobbed as he picked up the phone to dial my parents, who were at work. A year later, I saw Trucy outside a bar with her new boyfriend. I couldn't control myself and rushed up to them. ""YOU RUINED MY LIFE!"" The two of them were taken by surprise and the boyfriend raised his fist. ""YOU TOOK HER FROM ME"" I yelled. ""YOU TOOK MY LIFE FROM ME!"" and I swung wildly at him. Suddenly, there was an excruciating pain in my abdomen. I screamed, then I collapsed. Next thing I remember seeing was the cold, sterile hospital ceiling. I awoke to find Luke, Trucy and my parents by my side, her boyfriend leaning against the wall. The doctor came in, and revealed to me that I had a tumor in my liver. I started to cry. I had wasted my life, all my potential, over one stupid breakup. Why did I start doing drugs? Why did I start doing alcohol? ""It should be okay,"" the doctor said. ""But we'll need to monitor it for a while to look for any unusual developments. Rest now, ok?"" My tears turned into those of joy. It was like being born again. I had a second chance. It was time to turn over a new leaf. At the advice of Mr Anderson, my parents put aside their pride and hired a professional counsellor to guide me through the tough times. I also had to take antidepressants. But I was getting better. Trucy agreed that she had handled the breakup badly, and we promised to keep in touch, if only just as friends. I would laze in the couch feeling a little blue. Today, I was feeling it a little more than usual. I started playing Metal Gear Soild V half-heartedly to take my mind off it, when the doorbell rang. It was Luke. ""Came to visit,"" he said. ""How are things?"" ""Oh, they're alright."" We chatted for a while. Then he said. ""Cheer up, old sport. Here, have a look at this, figured you would find it funny."" He whipped out his iPhone 6 and opened up 4chan. And that's how I got cancer.",human,55nvn1,2,1475504678,0

"An antivaxer has a heart attack. He's rushed to ER, but during the emergency surgery, his heart stops, rendering him clinically dead.

Before he knows it, he's face to face with none other than God himself, Author of the Universe, Maker of All. God smiles beatifically and says, “Don't worry. The doctors working on you are good; you'll be back in no time. But as long as you're here, do you have any questions you'd like to ask?” The antivaxer thinks and says, “I know there must be reasons, beyond our understanding, why evil is allowed to exist. But why on Earth do you allow the evil, corrupt system of vaccines to exist?!” God shakes His head, patiently. “My child,” He says, “It is not evil to be mistaken. Which is to your benefit, because in this case, the mistake is yours. Just as so many people have tried to tell you over the years, vaccines are effective and far safer than the diseases they protect against. I give you My Word on that. Now, return, with My Peace upon you.” Suddenly, the antivaxer is staring up at the ceiling of an operating room, as his heart starts beating on its own once more. By the time he's able to receive visitors, the man is desperate to talk to his antivax friends, to let them know the vital truth he brought back from the other side. He calls them all and insisted that they be there at his side the very minute he's cleared to see anyone - he has huge, huge, HUGE news for them. Finally, his friends are gathered around him, and he motions for them to gather close. “It turns out,” he starts, “the conspiracy goes a LOT higher up than we thought…”",human,b8rr2g,2256,1554254634,0

"A couple with a rough patch go to councelling

A married couple hit a rough patch, so they book to see a relationship counsellor. The counsellor tries a few therapy techniques, but nothing works, it's like talking to two brick walls. Finally, he picks up a bass guitar and starts to play, simple at first, then gradually more and more intricate. The couple look at each other while he's playing, not sure what's going on, then they break the ice, and start opening up to each other. After a while, they'd turned a corner and started to feel better. The counsellor finished playing, and put down the bass. As they were wrapping up the appointment, the couple thanked the counsellor, but asked him why on earth he picked up the bass halfway through their session.\n\n\""Everyone talks during the bass solo.\""﻿",ai,ai_4381,0,0,1
